1,Synergetics and Its Application to Literature and Architecture,"V. P. Maslov, T. V. Maslova","nlin.AO, physics.soc-ph","A series of phenomena pertaining to economics, quantum physics, language, literary criticism, and especially architecture is studied from the standpoint of synergetics (the study of self-organizing complex systems). It turns out that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a ""quantized"" from of the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to the""blending in"" of new architectural structures in an existing environment."
2,Analyzing Walter Skeat's Forty-Five Parallel Extracts of William   Langland's Piers Plowman,Roger Bilisoly,"stat.AP, cs.CL","Walter Skeat published his critical edition of William Langland's 14th century alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he located forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts from each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these excerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition. First, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line, which is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of the arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain subset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string variance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean. Third, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a clustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal is to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic."
3,BourbOulipo. Relazioni tra Oulipo e Bourbaki,"Elena Toscano, M. Alessandra Vaccaro",math.HO,"The theme of the influence of Bourbaki's ideas and methodologies on disciplines that transcend the mathematical field has been frequently addressed and, in particular, the reflection on the relationship between Bourbaki and Oulipo has animated a passionate debate within literary criticism. The purpose of this contribution is to investigate the relations between Le Lionnais, Queneau and Roubaud - and more generally Oulipo - and Bourbaki. Through a comparative examination between the two groups, the existence of an undeniable charisma of the ""polycephalic mathematician"" on the artistic-literary movement was highlighted."
4,The Science Wars: a pox on both their houses,Stephen Boughn,physics.hist-ph,"According to physicist David Mermin, the science wars was a series of exchanges between scientists and ""sociologists, historians, and literary critics"" whom the scientists thought to be ""ludicrously ignorant of science, making all kinds of nonsensical pronouncements."" The science wars peaked in 1996 with the publication of a hoax article by physicist Alan Sokal in a cultural studies journal and then seemed mercifully to die away by the end of the 1990's. I recently noticed, however, that the kerfuffle has persisted. This motivated me to pen this essay and point out the silliness of the entire affair."
5,Edgar Allan Poe: the first man to conceive a Newtonian evolving Universe,"Paolo Molaro, Alberto Cappi","physics.hist-ph, astro-ph.CO","The notion that we live in an evolving universe was established only in the twentieth century with the discovery of the recession of galaxies by Hubble and with the Lemaitre and Friedmann's interpretation in the 1920s.   However, the concept of an evolving universe is intrinsically tied to the law of universal gravitation, and it is surprising that it remained unrecognized for more than two centuries. A remarkable exception to this lack of awareness is represented by Poe. In Eureka (1848), the writer developed a conception of an evolving universe following the reasoning that a physical universe cannot be static and nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other. Unfortunately this literary work was, and still is, very little understood both by the literary critics and scientists of the time. We will discuss Poe's cosmological views in their historical scientific context, highlighting the remarkable insights of the writer, such as those dealing with the Olbers paradox, the existence of other galaxies and of a multi-universe."
6,On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems,"Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau","physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, math.PR","Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies (""stemmata""), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic ""biodiversity"" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance (""drift"") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation."
7,Classical Philology. Notes on Fermat's way of thinking,V. Pizzigoni,"math.HO, 01A45",This study use some philological and historical means in order to understand Fermat's way of thinking.
8,Provenance of the Cross Sign of 806 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A   possible Lunar Halo over Continental Europe?,"Yuta Uchikawa, Les Cowley, Hisashi Hayakawa, David M. Willis, F. Richard Stephenson","physics.hist-ph, astro-ph.EP, physics.ao-ph, physics.geo-ph","While graphical records of astronomical/meteorological events before telescopic observations are of particular interest, they have frequently undergone multiple copying and may have been modified from the original. Here, we analyze a graphical record of the cross-sign of 806 CE in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which has been considered one of the earliest datable halo drawings in British records, whereas another cross-sign in 776 CE has been associated with the aurora. However, philological studies have revealed the later 806 event is derived from Continental annals. Here, records and drawings for the 806 event have been philologically traced back to mid-9th Century Continental manuscripts and the probable observational site identified as the area of Sens in northern France. The possible lunar halos at that time have been comprehensively examined by numerical ray tracing. Combined with calculations of twilight sky brightness, they identify a visibility window supporting monastic observation. Cruciform halos are shown to be fainter and rarer than brighter and more commonplace lunar halos. Physically credible cloud ice crystal variations can reproduce all the manuscript renditions. The manuscript records prove less than desirable detail but what is presented is fully consistent with a lunar halo interpretation. Finally, the possible societal impacts of such celestial events have been mentioned in the context of contemporary coins in Anglo-Saxon England and the Carolingian Empire. These analyses show that we need to trace their provenance back as far as possible, to best reconstruct the original event, even if graphical records are available for given astronomical/meteorological events."
9,From Past to Future: Digital Methods Towards Artefact Analysis,"Andrew Harris, Andrea Cremaschi, Tse Siang Lim, Maria De Iorio, Kwa Chong Guan",stat.AP,"Over the past two decades, Digital Humanities has transformed the landscape of humanities and social sciences, enabling advanced computational analysis and interpretation of extensive datasets. Notably, recent initiatives in Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore, focus on categorising and archiving historical data such as artwork, literature and, most notably archaeological artefacts. This study illustrates the profound potential of Digital Humanities through the application of statistical methods on two distinct artefact datasets. Specifically, we present the results of an automated die study on mid-1st millennium AD ""Rising Sun"" coinage from mainland Southeast Asia, while subsequently utilising unsupervised statistical methods on 2D images of 13th-14th century earthenware ceramics excavated from the precolonial St. Andrew's Cathedral site in central Singapore. This research offers a comparative assessment showcasing the transformative impact of statistics-based approaches on the interpretation and analysis of diverse archaeological materials and within Digital Humanities overall."
10,Tables in Leibniz: a challenge for the digital humanities,Ariles Remaki,math.HO,"Leibniz's mathematical texts are a perfect example of a type of historical document that is extremely difficult to deal with in the context of an editorial enterprise: the draft. The tables in Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts are a particularly good example of these difficulties, as they are equivocal sources containing many implicit operations. The publication of these texts raises the question of the nature of these signs and the economy of implicit relationships between their various components. Peirce's semiological approach provides the philosophical ground for these reflections, while Michel Serres's structuralism is a fertile source of inspiration. The digital tool holds much promise for many issues, including the particular difficulties of tables. We will show that it can be implemented by different computer structures which largely determine the way the historian conceives them a priori but also the way the reader receives them a posteriori. Finally, the tables are the simple case that founds a general problematic on the interpretation of many manuscripts and allows us to study the problem of the writing process at its root."
11,The cosmology of the Divine Comedy,Alejandro Gangui,"physics.hist-ph, astro-ph","Since the time of ancient civilizations, cosmology had a privileged place within the various artistic and literary manifestations. The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, one of the masterpieces in literature and thought of the Western World, is organized on the image of the cosmos of the XIII century, which is analyzed in this article."
12,"Statistics of punctuation in experimental literature -- the remarkable   case of ""Finnegans Wake"" by James Joyce","Tomasz Stanisz, Stanisław Drożdż, Jarosław Kwapień","physics.soc-ph, cs.CL, stat.AP","As the recent studies indicate, the structure imposed onto written texts by the presence of punctuation develops patterns which reveal certain characteristics of universality. In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. ""Finnegans Wake"" - the same one to which science owes the word ""quarks"" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is ""Finnegans Wake""."
13,Through the eyes of a reader and science communicator: science in the   mainstream and in the genre literature of yesterday and today,Valentin D. Ivanov,"physics.soc-ph, astro-ph.IM, physics.ed-ph","For most writers the science is either an exotic setting or a source of thrilling conflict that would drive the story forward. For a communicator it is the other way around - the science is neatly wrapped in a package of literary tools that make it ""invisible"" while it remains tangible and most importantly - it can be conveyed to the reader in understandable terms. There are many examples showing how these seemingly contradicting goals can complement each other successfully. I will review how the science was communicated by mainstream and genre writers of yesterday and today, and in different (not necessarily anglophone) cultures. I will bring forward the best and the worst examples that illuminate various astronomical concepts. Finally, I will discuss how we can use them both in outreach and education. Contrary to many similar summaries I will concentrate on some often overlooked mainstream literary examples, including the plays The Physicists by Friedrich D\""urrenmatt and Copenhagen by Michael Frayn, the novel White Garments by Vl. Dudintsev and even an episode of the Inspector Morse TV show, featuring scientists. I will also mention in passing a few less well known genre books."
14,Temporal Network Analysis of Literary Texts,"Sandra D. Prado, Silvio R. Dahmen, Ana L. C. Bazzan, Padraig Mac Carron, Ralph Kenna","physics.soc-ph, cs.CL","We study temporal networks of characters in literature focusing on ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (1865) by Lewis Carroll and the anonymous ""La Chanson de Roland"" (around 1100). The former, one of the most influential pieces of nonsense literature ever written, describes the adventures of Alice in a fantasy world with logic plays interspersed along the narrative. The latter, a song of heroic deeds, depicts the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 A.D. during Charlemagne's campaign on the Iberian Peninsula. We apply methods recently developed by Taylor and coworkers \cite{Taylor+2015} to find time-averaged eigenvector centralities, Freeman indices and vitalities of characters. We show that temporal networks are more appropriate than static ones for studying stories, as they capture features that the time-independent approaches fail to yield."
15,Mathematical Symbolism in a Russian Literary Masterpiece,"Noah Giansiracusa, Anastasia Vasilyeva","math.HO, 01A72, 00A30","Andrei Bely's modernist novel ""Petersburg,"" first published in 1913, is considered a pinnacle of the Symbolist movement. Nabokov famously ranked it as one of the four greatest masterpieces of 20th-century prose. The author's father, Bugaev, was an influential mathematician and for 12 years served as the president of the Moscow Mathematical Society; he was also a source of inspiration for one of the main characters in the son's novel. While the philosophical views and political leanings of the mathematicians surrounding Bely, and their impact on ""Petersburg,"" have been a topic of recent academic interest, there has not yet been a direct investigation of the surprisingly frequent and sophisticated mathematical passages in the book itself. We attempt here to rectify this gap in the scholarly literature, and in doing so find a rich tapestry of mathematical ideas and allusions."
16,Network analysis of the Kyiv bylyny cycle -- east Slavic epic narratives,"Petro Sarkanych, Nazar Fedorak, Yurij Holovatch, Pádraig MacCarron, Joseph Yose, Ralph Kenna","physics.soc-ph, cs.SI","In recent times, the advent of network science permitted new quantitative approaches to literary studies. Here we bring the Kyiv bylyny cycle into the field - East Slavic epic narratives originating in modern-day Ukraine. By comparing them to other prominent European epics, we identify universal and distinguishing properties of the social networks in bylyny. We analyse community structures and rank the most important characters. The method allows to bolster hypotheses from humanities literature - such as the position of Prince Volodymyr - and to generate new ones We show how the Kyiv cycle of bylyny fits very well with narrative networks from other nations - especially heroic ones. We anticipate that, besides delivering new narratological insights, this study will aid future scholars and interested public to navigate their way through Ukraine's epic story and identify its heroes."
17,"Rate of convergence in the maximum likelihood estimation for partial   discrete parameter, with applications to the cluster analysis and philology","E. Ostrovsky, L. Sirota, A. Zeldin","math.ST, stat.TH",The problem of estimation of the distribution parameters on the sample when the part of these parameters are discrete (e.g. integer) is considered. We prove that the rate of convergence of MLE estimates under the natural conditions on the distribution density is exponentially fast.
18,"Parametric density-based optimization of partition in cluster analysis,   with applications","E. Ostrovsky, L. Sirota, A. Zeldin","math.ST, stat.TH","We developed an optimal in the natural sense algorithm of partition in cluster analysis based on the densities of observations in the different hypotheses. These densities may be characterized, for instance, as the multivariate so-called ""quasi-Gaussian distribution"".   We describe also the possible applications in technical diagnosis, demography and philology."
19,Singularities,Alan H. Durfee,math.AG,"This article recounts the interaction of topology and singularity theory (mainly singularities of complex algebraic varieties) which started in the early part of this century and bloomed in the 1960's with the work of Hirzebruch, Brieskorn, Milnor and others. Some of the topics are followed to the present day. (A chapter for the book ""History of Topology"", ed. I. M. James)"
20,The ontogeny of discourse structure mimics the development of literature,"Natalia Bezerra Mota, Sylvia Pinheiro, Mariano Sigman, Diego Fernandez Slezak, Guillermo Cecchi, Mauro Copelli, Sidarta Ribeiro","q-bio.NC, cs.CL, physics.soc-ph","Discourse varies with age, education, psychiatric state and historical epoch, but the ontogenetic and cultural dynamics of discourse structure remain to be quantitatively characterized. To this end we investigated word graphs obtained from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning ~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically, discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from randomness."
21,Advancing Zero-Shot Digital Human Quality Assessment through   Text-Prompted Evaluation,"Zicheng Zhang, Wei Sun, Yingjie Zhou, Haoning Wu, Chunyi Li, Xiongkuo Min, Xiaohong Liu, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin","eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.DB","Digital humans have witnessed extensive applications in various domains, necessitating related quality assessment studies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive digital human quality assessment (DHQA) databases. To address this gap, we propose SJTU-H3D, a subjective quality assessment database specifically designed for full-body digital humans. It comprises 40 high-quality reference digital humans and 1,120 labeled distorted counterparts generated with seven types of distortions. The SJTU-H3D database can serve as a benchmark for DHQA research, allowing evaluation and refinement of processing algorithms. Further, we propose a zero-shot DHQA approach that focuses on no-reference (NR) scenarios to ensure generalization capabilities while mitigating database bias. Our method leverages semantic and distortion features extracted from projections, as well as geometry features derived from the mesh structure of digital humans. Specifically, we employ the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to measure semantic affinity and incorporate the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) model to capture low-level distortion information. Additionally, we utilize dihedral angles as geometry descriptors to extract mesh features. By aggregating these measures, we introduce the Digital Human Quality Index (DHQI), which demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot performance. The DHQI can also serve as a robust baseline for DHQA tasks, facilitating advancements in the field. The database and the code are available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/SJTU-H3D."
22,Statistical Properties of European Languages and Voynich Manuscript   Analysis,"Andronik Arutyunov, Leonid Borisov, Sergey Fedorov, Anastasiya Ivchenko, Elizabeth Kirina-Lilinskaya, Yurii Orlov, Konstantin Osminin, Sergey Shilin, Dmitriy Zeniuk","stat.AP, cs.CL",The statistical properties of letters frequencies in European literature texts are investigated. The determination of logarithmic dependence of letters sequence for one-language and two-language texts are examined. The pare of languages is suggested for Voynich Manuscript. The internal structure of Manuscript is considered. The spectral portraits of two-letters distribution are constructed.
