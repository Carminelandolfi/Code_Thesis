It turns out that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a \"quantized\" from of the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to the\"blending in\" of new architectural structures in an existing environment.",

    "abstract": "Walter Skeat published his critical edition of William Langland's 14th century alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he located forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts from each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these excerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition. First, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line, which is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of the arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain subset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string variance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean. Third, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a clustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal is to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic.",

However, the concept of an evolving universe is intrinsically tied to the law of universal gravitation, and it is surprising that it remained unrecognized for more than two centuries. A remarkable exception to this lack of awareness is represented by Poe. In Eureka (1848), the writer developed a conception of an evolving universe following the reasoning that a physical universe cannot be static and nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other. Unfortunately this literary work was, and still is, very little understood both by the literary critics and scientists of the time. We will discuss Poe's cosmological views in their historical scientific context, highlighting the remarkable insights of the writer, such as those dealing with the Olbers paradox, the existence of other galaxies and of a multi-universe.",

For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies (\"stemmata\"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic \"biodiversity\" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance (\"drift\") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.",

Here, we analyze a graphical record of the cross-sign of 806 CE in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which has been considered one of the earliest datable halo drawings in British records, whereas another cross-sign in 776 CE has been associated with the aurora. However, philological studies have revealed the later 806 event is derived from Continental annals. Here, records and drawings for the 806 event have been philologically traced back to mid-9th Century Continental manuscripts and the probable observational site identified as the area of Sens in northern France. The possible lunar halos at that time have been comprehensively examined by numerical ray tracing. Combined with calculations of twilight sky brightness, they identify a visibility window supporting monastic observation. Cruciform halos are shown to be fainter and rarer than brighter and more commonplace lunar halos. Physically credible cloud ice crystal variations can reproduce all the manuscript renditions. The manuscript records prove less than desirable detail but what is presented is fully consistent with a lunar halo interpretation. Finally, the possible societal impacts of such celestial events have been mentioned in the context of contemporary coins in Anglo-Saxon England and the Carolingian Empire. These analyses show that we need to trace their provenance back as far as possible, to best reconstruct the original event, even if graphical records are available for given astronomical/meteorological events.",

The tables in Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts are a particularly good example of these difficulties, as they are equivocal sources containing many implicit operations. The publication of these texts raises the question of the nature of these signs and the economy of implicit relationships between their various components. Peirce's semiological approach provides the philosophical ground for these reflections, while Michel Serres's structuralism is a fertile source of inspiration. The digital tool holds much promise for many issues, including the particular difficulties of tables. We will show that it can be implemented by different computer structures which largely determine the way the historian conceives them a priori but also the way the reader receives them a posteriori. Finally, the tables are the simple case that founds a general problematic on the interpretation of many manuscripts and allows us to study the problem of the writing process at its root.",

    "abstract": "As the recent studies indicate, the structure imposed onto written texts by the presence of punctuation develops patterns which reveal certain characteristics of universality. In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. \"Finnegans Wake\" - the same one to which science owes the word \"quarks\" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is \"Finnegans Wake\".",

Contrary to many similar summaries I will concentrate on some often overlooked mainstream literary examples, including the plays The Physicists by Friedrich D\\\"urrenmatt and Copenhagen by Michael Frayn, the novel White Garments by Vl.

To this end we investigated word graphs obtained from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning ~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically, discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from randomness.",

    "abstract": "Digital humans have witnessed extensive applications in various domains, necessitating related quality assessment studies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive digital human quality assessment (DHQA) databases. To address this gap, we propose SJTU-H3D, a subjective quality assessment database specifically designed for full-body digital humans. It comprises 40 high-quality reference digital humans and 1,120 labeled distorted counterparts generated with seven types of distortions. The SJTU-H3D database can serve as a benchmark for DHQA research, allowing evaluation and refinement of processing algorithms. Further, we propose a zero-shot DHQA approach that focuses on no-reference (NR) scenarios to ensure generalization capabilities while mitigating database bias. Our method leverages semantic and distortion features extracted from projections, as well as geometry features derived from the mesh structure of digital humans. Specifically, we employ the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to measure semantic affinity and incorporate the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) model to capture low-level distortion information. Additionally, we utilize dihedral angles as geometry descriptors to extract mesh features. By aggregating these measures, we introduce the Digital Human Quality Index (DHQI), which demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot performance. The DHQI can also serve as a robust baseline for DHQA tasks, facilitating advancements in the field. The database and the code are available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/SJTU-H3D.",

    "abstract": "In 1760 James Macpherson published the first volume of a series of epic poems which he claimed to have translated into English from ancient Scottish-Gaelic sources. The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Sen\\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology.",

A fractal power law is obtained for the lexical wealth defined as the ratio between the number of different words and the total number of words of a given text. By considering as a signature of each author the exponent and the amplitude of the power law, and the standard deviation of the lexical wealth, it is possible to discriminate works of different genres and writers and show that each writer has a very distinct signature, either considered among other literary writers or compared with writers of non-literary texts. It is also shown that, for a given author, the signature is able to discriminate between short stories and novels.",

While previous research has suggested that punctuation marks--particularly full stops--generate structural regularities in narrative texts, our experiments challenge this view. Using Chinese as the primary language, supplemented with English, we constructed randomized linguistic sequences through three distinct methods. Surprisingly, these randomized texts also exhibit long-range correlations in sentence length, some even with stronger fractal characteristics than those found in canonical literary works. These findings suggest that the presence of long-range correlations in sentence length is not sufficient to indicate authorial intention, structural depth, or literary value. We argue that punctuation-induced long-range correlations have limited value for literary stylistic analysis and cannot be considered a fundamental characteristic of human writing.",

The latter correspond to time periods coinciding with relevant literary movements over the last 5 centuries. The most important factor contributing to the distinction between different literary styles was {the average shortest path length (particularly, the asymmetry of the distribution)}. Furthermore, over time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths, which is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use of the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution of word frequency. Changes in literary style were also found to be driven by opposition to earlier writing styles, as revealed by the analysis performed with geometrical concepts. The approaches adopted here are generic and may be extended to analyze a number of features of languages and cultures.",

Nevertheless, a formal definition of what a balance index actually is and what makes it a useful measure of balance (or, in other cases, imbalance), has so far not been introduced in the literature. While the established indices all summarize the (im)balance of a tree in a single number, they vary in their definitions and underlying principles. It is the aim of the present manuscript to introduce formal definitions of balance and imbalance indices that classify desirable properties of such indices and to analyze and categorize established indices accordingly. In this regard, we review 19 established (im)balance indices from the literature, summarize their general, statistical and combinatorial properties (where known), prove numerous additional results and indicate directions for future research by making explicit open questions and gaps in the literature. We also prove that a few tree shape statistics that have been used to measure tree balance in the literature do not fulfill our definition of an (im)balance index, which might indicate that their properties are not as useful for practical purposes. Moreover, we show that five additional tree shape statistics from other contexts actually are tree (im)balance indices according to our definition. The manuscript is accompanied by the website \\url{treebalance.wordpress.com} containing fact sheets of the discussed indices. Moreover, we introduce the software package \\verb|treebalance| implemented in $\\mathsf{R}$ that can be used to calculate all indices discussed.",

    "abstract": "Fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) developed through iterated function systems (IFSs) prove more versatile than classical interpolants. However, the applications of FIFs in the domain of `shape preserving interpolation' are not fully addressed so far. Among various techniques available in the classical numerical analysis, rational interpolation schemes are well suited for the shape preservation problems and shape modification analysis. In this paper, the capability of FIFs to generalize smooth classical interpolants, and the effectiveness of rational function models in shape preservation are intertwingly exploited to provide a new solution to the shape preserving interpolation problem in fractal perspective. As a common platform for these two techniques to work together, we introduce rational cubic spline FIFs involving tension parameters for the first time in literature. Suitable conditions on parameters of the associated IFS are developed so that the rational fractal interpolant inherits fundamental shape properties such as monotonicity, convexity, and positivity present in the given data. With some suitable hypotheses on the original function, the convergence analysis of the $\\mathcal{C}^1$-rational cubic spline FIF is carried out. Due to the presence of the scaling factors in the rational cubic spline fractal interpolant, our approach generalizes the classical results on the shape preserving rational interpolation by Delbourgo and Gregory [SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 6 (1985), pp. 967-976]. The effectiveness of the shape preserving interpolation schemes are illustrated with suitably chosen numerical examples and graphs, which support the practical utility of our methods.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent spinal deformity, significantly affects individuals' health and quality of life. Conventional imaging techniques, such as X - rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer static views of the spine. However, they are restricted in capturing the dynamic changes of the spine and its interactions with overall body motion. Therefore, developing new techniques to address these limitations has become extremely important. Dynamic digital human modeling represents a major breakthrough in digital medicine. It enables a three - dimensional (3D) view of the spine as it changes during daily activities, assisting clinicians in detecting deformities that might be missed in static imaging. Although dynamic modeling holds great potential, constructing an accurate static digital human model is a crucial initial step for high - precision simulations. In this study, our focus is on constructing an accurate static digital human model integrating the spine, which is vital for subsequent dynamic digital human research on AIS. First, we generate human point - cloud data by combining the 3D Gaussian method with the Skinned Multi - Person Linear (SMPL) model from the patient's multi - view images. Then, we fit a standard skeletal model to the generated human model. Next, we align the real spine model reconstructed from CT images with the standard skeletal model. We validated the resulting personalized spine model using X - ray data from six AIS patients, with Cobb angles (used to measure the severity of scoliosis) as evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the model's error was within 1 degree of the actual measurements. This study presents an important method for constructing digital humans.",

[arXiv:0905.0269v2] (now published in Nature, vol. 463, p. 214-217, 2010), which suggests that in certain conditions a single diffraction measurement may be sufficient to reconstruct the full three-dimensional density of a scatterer. We show that past literature contains the tools to assess rigorously the feasibility of this approach. We question the formulation of the reconstruction algorithm used by the authors and we argue that the experimental data used as a demonstration is not suitable for this method, and thus that the reconstruction is not valid.   This second version was produced for documentation purposes. In addition to the minimally modified original comment, it includes in appendix a subsequent reply to one of the authors (J. Miao).",

However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies.",

In case of $p<q$ optimality is proven for fast decaying diagonal sequences, which include exponentially decreasing sequences. In case of $p>q$ we show optimality under weaker assumption than previously used in the literature.

Remarkably, the traditional axiomatization of Shapley values can be extended to this general setting for a rather interesting class of complexes that generalize the notion of vertex-transitive graphs and vertex-homogeneous simplicial complexes.

We show that Polish texts are described by the Zipf law with the scaling exponent smaller than the one for the English language. We also show that the scientific texts are typically characterized by the rank-frequency plots with relatively short range of power-law behavior as compared to the literary texts. We then transform the texts into their word-adjacency network representations and find another difference between the languages. For the majority of the literary texts in both languages, the corresponding networks revealed the scale-free structure, while this was not always the case for the scientific texts. However, all the network representations of texts were hierarchical. We do not observe any qualitative and quantitative difference between the languages. However, if we look at other network statistics like the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length, the English texts occur to possess more clustered structure than do the Polish ones. This result was attributed to differences in grammar of both languages, which was also indicated in the Zipf plots. All the texts, however, show network structure that differs from any of the Watts-Strogatz, the Barabasi-Albert, and the Erdos-Renyi architectures.",

In this work, we propose an approach to synthesise poems with almost human like naturalness in order to enable literary scholars to systematically examine hypotheses on the interplay between text, spoken realisation, and the listener's perception of poems. To meet these special requirements for literary studies, we resynthesise poems by cloning prosodic values from a human reference recitation, and afterwards make use of fine-grained prosody control to manipulate the synthetic speech in a human-in-the-loop setting to alter the recitation w.r.t. specific phenomena. We find that finetuning our TTS model on poetry captures poetic intonation patterns to a large extent which is beneficial for prosody cloning and manipulation and verify the success of our approach both in an objective evaluation as well as in human studies.",

Remarkably, the resulting adaptive detectors usually possess the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) properties, and hence no additional CFAR processing is needed. Filtering is not needed as a processing procedure either, since the function of filtering is embedded in the adaptive detector. Moreover, adaptive detection usually exhibits better detection performance than the filtering-then-CFAR detection technique. Multichannel adaptive signal detection has been more than 30 years since the first multichannel adaptive detector was proposed by Kelly in 1986. However, there are fewer overview articles on this topic. In this paper we give a tutorial overview of multichannel adaptive signal detection, with emphasis on Gaussian background. We present the main deign criteria for adaptive detectors, investigate the relationship between adaptive detection and filtering-then-CFAR detection, relationship between adaptive detectors and adaptive filters, summarize typical adaptive detectors, show numerical examples, give comprehensive literature review, and discuss some possible further research tracks.",

We critically review the experimental measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as 0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6% are probably unavoidable. The consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.",

Results: Schoolyard greening consistently increases utilization and has a positive, though variable, effect on childrens physical activity and well-being. However, the benefits are not always equitably distributed, and greening projects can catalyze neighborhood change, sometimes leading to green gentrification. Conclusions: Greening urban schoolyards offers benefits for childrens health and urban sustainability but poses challenges for equity and social justice.

[Th/Eu] abundance ratios for a sample of 20 disk dwarfs/subgiants of F5 to G8 spectral type with -0.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3, determined in the first paper of this series, were adopted for this analysis. We developed a Galactic chemical evolution model that includes the effect of refuses, which are composed of stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) and low-mass stellar formation residues (terrestrial planets, comets, etc.), contributing to a better fit to observational constraints. Two Galactic disk ages were estimated, by comparing literature data on Th/Eu production and solar abundance ratios to the model ((8.7 +5.8-4.1) Gyr), and by comparing [Th/Eu] vs. [Fe/H] curves from the model to our stellar abundance ratio data ((8.2 +/- 1.9) Gyr), yielding the final, average value (8.3 +/- 1.8) Gyr. This is the first Galactic disk age determined via Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology, and corroborates the most recent white dwarf ages determined via cooling sequence calculations, which indicate a low age (<~ 10 Gyr) for the disk.",

Furthermore, Plato often supplemented such basic remarks by diffusely veiled and varied allusions that were often ironically hidden somewhere in his dialogues by inconspicuous double meanings. However, this mode of intentionally coded discrete communication was generally not understood because such irony is not to everyone's taste. However, the attempts to reconstruct Plato's system on the basis of admittedly individually interpreted double meanings lead to a conclusive mathematical-physical cyclical system of dimensions. Additionally it was possible to assign Plato's system of philosophical ideas analogously to this cyclical system. Plato took the verifiability of the mathematical-physical results as proof of the system of his ideas and finally as proof of his ethical creed, the unconditional trust in the 'all surmounting Good.'",

Fortunately, nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) translation can be used to circumvent the challenges of translating such substantial number of texts. To validate this tool, benchmark tests have been performed to compare the performance of two popular AI translating algorithms, namely Google Translate and ChatGPT. Additional tests were accomplished in translating an excerpt of a 1739 letter from Johann Bernoulli to Euler, where he announces that he was sending Euler the first part of his manuscript Hydraulica. Overall, the comparative results show that ChatGPT performed better that Google Translate not only in the benchmark tests but also in the translation of this letter, highlighting the superiority of ChatGPT as a translation tool, catering not only to general Latin practitioners but also proving beneficial for specialized Latin translators.",

Among them, Cencov and Petz characterized all the monotone metrics in the classical and quantum state space. As for channels, however, only a little is known about its geometrical structures. In that author's previous manuscript, the upper and the lower bound of monotone channel metric was derived using resource conversion theory, and it is proved that any monotone metric cannot be Riemanian. . Due to the latter result, we cannot rely on Cencov's theory, to build a geometric theory consistent across probability distributions and channels. To dispense with the assumption that a metric is Riemanian, we introduce some assumptions on asymptotic behavior;weak asymptotic additivity and lower asymptotic continuity. The proof utilizes resource conversion technique. In the end of the paper, an implication on quantum state metrics is discussed.",

The methods used for sensitivity analysis are divided into deterministic and statistical techniques. Generally, deterministic techniques analyze fixed points of a model whilst stochastic techniques analyze a range of values. Deterministic methods fail in analyze the entire range of input values and stochastic methods generate outcomes with random errors. In this manuscript, we are interested in stochastic methods, mainly in variance-based techniques such as Variance and Sobol indices, since this class of techniques is largely used on literature. The objective of this manuscript is to present an analytical solution for variance based sensitive analysis. As a result of this research, two small programs were developed in Javascript named as AVaN Pack (Analysis of Variance through Numerical solution). These programs allow users to find the contribution of each individual parameter in any function by means of a mathematical solution, instead of sampling-based ones.",

The present comment recalls some relevant literature in quantum theory and shows that (i) Gelman & Yao's statements are false; in fact, the quantum example confirms the rules of probability theory; (ii) the particular inequality found in the quantum example can be shown to appear also in very non-quantum examples, such as drawing from an urn; thus there is nothing peculiar to quantum theory in this matter.

In this Ph.D manuscript, we revisit an approach based on the tools of statistical physics of disordered systems. Developed through a rich literature, they have been precisely designed to infer the macroscopic behavior of a large number of particles from their microscopic interactions. At the heart of this work, we strongly capitalize on the deep connection between the replica method and message passing algorithms in order to shed light on the phase diagrams of various theoretical models, with an emphasis on the potential differences between statistical and algorithmic thresholds. We essentially focus on synthetic tasks and data generated in the teacher-student paradigm. In particular, we apply these mean-field methods to the Bayes-optimal analysis of committee machines, to the worst-case analysis of Rademacher generalization bounds for perceptrons, and to empirical risk minimization in the context of generalized linear models. Finally, we develop a framework to analyze estimation models with structured prior informations, produced for instance by deep neural networks based generative models with random weights.",

In this manuscript, we study the choice of prior for the variance or precision matrix when Gaussian kernels are adopted. Typically, in the relevant literature, the assessment of mixture models is done by considering observations in a space of only a handful of dimensions. Instead, we are concerned with more realistic problems of higher dimensionality, in a space of up to 20 dimensions. We observe that the choice of prior is increasingly important as the dimensionality of the problem increases. After identifying certain undesirable properties of standard priors in problems of higher dimensionality, we review and implement possible alternative priors. The most promising priors are identified, as well as other factors that affect the convergence of MCMC samplers. Our results show that the choice of prior is critical for deriving reliable posterior inferences. This manuscript offers a thorough overview and comparative investigation into possible priors, with detailed guidelines for their implementation. Although our work focuses on the use of the DPMM in clustering, it is also applicable to density estimation.",

In recent years, machine learning has been increasingly applied to materials science. Based on this, this manuscript proposes the use of XGBoost model to identify superconductors; the first application of deep forest model to predict the critical temperature of superconductors; the first application of deep forest to predict the band gap of materials; and application of a new sub-network model to predict the Fermi energy level of materials.

Solving polynomial optimization problems to global optimality is a ubiquitous challenge in many areas of science and engineering. Historically, different approaches on how to solve nonconvex polynomial optimization problems based on convex relaxations have been developed in different scientific communities. Here, we introduce the concept of monomial patterns. A pattern determines what monomials are to be linked by convex constraints in a convex relaxation of a polynomial optimization problem. This concept helps to understand existing approaches from different schools of thought, to develop novel relaxation schemes, and to derive a flexible duality theory, which can be specialized to many concrete situations that have been considered in the literature. We unify different approaches to polynomial optimization including polyhedral approximations, dense semidefinite relaxations, SONC, SAGE, and TSSOS in a self-contained exposition. We also carry out computational experiments to demonstrate the practical advantages of a flexible usage of pattern-based sparse relaxations of polynomial optimization problems.",

We start out reviewing the diverse animal species studied so far and then focus on the experimental techniques used to study them quantitatively. Our network analysis reveals how the three clades of animals performing powered flight - insects, birds and bats - are studied using substantially different combinations of measurement techniques. We then combine these insights with a new paradigm for increasing our physical understanding of flight. This paradigm relies on the concept of Animal Learning, where animals are used as probes to study fluid phenomena and variables involved in flight, harnessing their natural adaptability.",

However, there are a variety of configurations, parameters and performance criteria of solar assisted ASHP systems, leading to a major inconsistency that increase the degree of complexity to compare and implement different systems. A comparative literature review is lacking, with the aim to evaluate the performance of various ASHP systems from three main solar sources, such as solar thermal (ST), photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T). This paper thus conducts a systematic review of the prevailing solar assisted ASHP systems, including their boundary conditions, system configurations, performance indicators, research methodologies and system performance. The comparison result indicates that PV-ASHP system has the best techno-economic performance, which performs best in average with coefficient of performance (COP) of around 3.75, but with moderate cost and payback time. While ST-ASHP and PV/T-ASHP systems have lower performance with mean COP of 2.90 and 3.03, respectively. Moreover, PV/T-ASHP system has the highest cost and longest payback time, while ST-ASHP has the lowest ones.

An interesting direction for future investigations would be identifying what are the specific features which cause certain texts to be multifractal and other to be monofractal or even not fractal at all.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the approach of network mapping of words in literary texts is extended to ''textual factors'': the network nodes are defined as ''concepts''; the links are ''community connexions''. Thereafter, the text network properties are investigated along modern statistical physics approaches of networks, thereby relating network topology and algebraic properties, to literary texts contents. As a practical illustration, the first chapter of the Genesis in the Bible is mapped into a 10 node network, as in the Kabbalah approach, mentioning God ($\\equiv Elohim$). The characteristics of the network are studied starting from its adjacency matrix, and the corresponding Laplacian matrix. Triplets of nodes are particularly examined in order to emphasize the ''textual (community) connexions'' of each agent \"emanation\", through the so called clustering coefficients and the overlap index, whence measuring the ''semantic flow'' between the different nodes. It is concluded that this graph is a small-world network, weakly dis-assortative, because its average local clustering coefficient is significantly higher than a random graph constructed on the same vertex set.",

Its original formulation contains only glucose, NaOH and small amount of methylene blue. The solution turns blue when shaken and fades to colorless upon standing. This bluing/de-bluing cycle may be repeated and may be compared to blood colors in animal's respiratory cycle. Inspired by the blue bottle experiment, the colorful chemical bottle experiment kit was commercially developed in 2006. The kit is a versatile pedagogical tool, not only for physical chemistry but also for analytical, biological and organic chemistry. It also helps teaching concepts in scientific method and laboratory safety. This manuscript contains four parts, brief review on literature relating to the blue bottle experiment, description of the colorful chemical bottle experiment kit, pedagogical discussion of the experiments and preliminary evaluation from students.",

To address this challenge, the energy exchanges have been developing further trading possibilities, especially the intraday and balancing markets. For an energy trader participating in both markets, the forecasting of imbalance prices is of particular interest. Therefore, in this manuscript we conduct a very short-term probabilistic forecasting of imbalance prices, contributing to the scarce literature in this novel subject. The forecasting is performed 30 minutes before the delivery, so that the trader might still choose the trading place. The distribution of the imbalance prices is modelled and forecasted using methods well-known in the electricity price forecasting literature: lasso with bootstrap, gamlss, and probabilistic neural networks. The methods are compared with a naive benchmark in a meaningful rolling window study. The results provide evidence of the efficiency between the intraday and balancing markets as the sophisticated methods do not substantially overperform the intraday continuous price index. On the other hand, they significantly improve the empirical coverage. The analysis was conducted on the German market, however it could be easily applied to any other market of similar structure.",

When chemical species and reaction rates in a reaction system have different orders of magnitude, the associated stochastic system is often modeled in a multiscale regime. It is known that multiscale models can be approximated with a reduced system such as mean field dynamics or hybrid systems, but the accuracy of the approximation remains unknown. In this paper, we estimate the probability distribution of low copy species in multiscale stochastic reaction systems under short-time scale. We also establish an error bound for this approximation. Throughout the manuscript, typical mass action systems are mainly handled, but we also show that the main theorem can extended to general kinetics, which generalizes existing results in the literature. Our approach is based on a direct analysis of the Kolmogorov equation, in contrast to classical approaches in the existing literature.",

The development of over 40 vaccines and immunoprophylactic interventions targeting RSV has the potential to significantly reduce the disease burden from RSV infection in the near future. In the context of RSV, a highly contagious pathogen, dynamic transmission models (DTMs) are valuable tools in the evaluation and comparison of the effectiveness of different interventions. This review, the first of its kind for RSV DTMs, provides a valuable foundation for future modelling efforts and highlights important gaps in our understanding of RSV epidemics. Specifically, we have searched the literature using Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PubMed to identify all published manuscripts reporting the development of DTMs focused on the population transmission of RSV. We reviewed the resulting studies and summarized the structure, parameterization, and results of the models developed therein. We anticipate that future RSV DTMs, combined with cost-effectiveness evaluations, will play a significant role in shaping decision making in the development and implementation of intervention programs.",

Operating on the vast composition space of double oxide perovskite compositions available in literature and online repositories, in this manuscript, an attempt has been made to extract the relationship between the composition and structure to predict their formability and stability. Machine learning (ML) classifiers are trained on these datasets to predict novel stable perovskite compositions. The study uses a vast feature space to narrow down the most important factors affecting the formability and stability in perovskite compounds.

We focus on three main aspects: Testing for jumps; rough fractional stochastic volatility; and limit order microstructure noise. We review jump tests based on extreme value theory and complement the literature proposing new statistical methods. They are based on asymptotic theory of order statistics and the R\\'{e}nyi representation. The second stage of our journey visits a recent strand of research showing that volatility is rough. We further investigate this and establish a minimax lower bound exploring frontiers to what extent the regularity of latent volatility can be recovered in a more general framework.

Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator.",

Since in many networks a power-law (scale-free) node-degree distribution can be observed, power-law might be seen as a universal characteristics of networks. But this study of communication in the Flickr social online network reveals that power-law node-degree distributions are restricted to only sparsely connected networks. More densely connected networks, by contrast, show an increasing divergence from power-law. This work shows that this observation is consistent with the classic idea from social sciences that similarity is the driving factor behind communication in social networks. The strong relation between communication strength and node similarity could be confirmed by analyzing the Flickr network. It also is shown that node similarity as a network formation model can reproduce the characteristics of different network densities and hence can be used as a model for describing the topological transition from weakly to strongly connected societies.",

In this context, the Carrington storm in September 1859 is considered as a benchmark of observational history owing to its magnetic disturbance and equatorial extent of the auroral oval. So far, several recent auroral reports at that time have been published but those reports are mainly derived from the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, we analyse datable auroral reports from South America and its vicinity, assess the auroral extent using philological and astrometric approaches, identify the auroral visibility at - 17.3{\\deg} magnetic latitude and further poleward and reconstruct the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval to be 25.1{\\deg} +/- 0.5{\\deg} in invariant latitude. Interestingly, brighter and more colourful auroral displays were reported in the South American sector than in the Northern Hemisphere. This north-south asymmetry is presumably associated with variations of their magnetic longitude and the weaker magnetic field over South America compared to the magnetic conjugate point and the increased amount of magnetospheric electron precipitation into the upper atmosphere. These results attest that the magnitude of the Carrington storm indicates that its extent falls within the range of other superstorms, such as those that occurred in May 1921 and February 1872, in terms of the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval.",

We propose that a modified dynamical sound speed can be defined through the linear perturbation of the full space-time dependent equations describing the aforementioned accretion flow structure. The linear stability analysis of such fluid equations leads to the formation of an wave equation which describes the propagation of linear acoustic perturbation. The speed of propagation of such perturbation can be used as the effective sound speed which makes the value of the Mach number to be unity when evaluated at the critical points. This allows the critical points to coalesce with the sonic points. We study how the spin angular momentum of the black hole (the Kerr parameter) influences the value of the effective sound speed.",

Moving forward, the understanding of CQE is utilized to describe the geometric structure of CQF, and the CQE-CQF relation. All these results are shown closely related to a basis in the optimization literature, namely quadratic programming (QP). For the first time from this viewpoint, the QPs subject to equality, inequality, equality-and-inequality, and extended constraints can be algebraically solved in derivative-free closed formulae, respectively.

Then, we study pure scalar and pure vector cases. In each case, we derive an analytic expression of the energy spectrum by employing the asymptotic iteration method. We obtain a non-trivial relation among the tuning parameters which lead the examined problem to a constant mass one. Finally, we calculate the energy spectrum by the Secant method and show that the corresponding unnormalized wave functions satisfy the boundary conditions.

While many of its statistical properties under different probabilistic models for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known about its minimum value and the trees that achieve it. In this manuscript, we fill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and closed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with $n$ leaves. Surprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless index and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve. We then fully characterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce both an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them. After focusing on two extremal classes of trees with minimum Colless index (the maximally balanced trees and the greedy from the bottom trees), we conclude by showing that all trees with minimum Colless index also have minimum Sackin index, another popular balance index.",

In the language of bundle theory, one can construct a vector bundle over the set of all possible motion states of a massive particle, in whose fibers the moving particle's internal quantum state as perceived by a fixed inertial observer is encoded. A link between the usual Hilbert space description is provided by a generalized induced representation construction on the $L^2$-section space of the bundle. The aim of this paper is two-fold. One is to communicate the basic ideas of RQI to mathematicians and the other is to suggest an improved formalism for single-particle state spaces that encompasses all known massive particles including those which have never been dealt with in the RQI literature. Some of the theoretical implications of the formalism will be explored at the end of the paper.",

We show that correct test sequences are almost omnipresent and appear in many different forms in the mathematical literature: As identity sequences for Function Identity Test, as norming sets in the field of Banach algebras or as samples in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. As main outcome, we generalize the main statement of Heintz-Schnorr (1982) proving that short correct test sequences for constructible sets of lists of polynomials do exist and are densely distributed in any constructible set of accurate dimension and degree. The main tool used to prove this result is the theory of degree of constructible sets, which we introduce and develop in this manuscript, generalizing the results of Heintz (1983) and proving two Bezout's Inequalities for two different notions of degree. We present a ${\\bf BPP}_K$ algorithm to exhibit the power of correct test sequences, this algorithm decides whether a list of polynomials is a secant sequence by just evaluating the input list at some well-suited points. We show the differences between correct test sequences and Demillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel probabilistic tests and we reformulate, prove and generalize two well-known results of the Polynomial Method: We prove Dvir's exponential lower bounds for Kakeya sets from lower bounds for the length of correct test sequences and generalize Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.",

    "abstract": "In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \\enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \\emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.   \\textbf{Keywords:} consensus tree, phylogenetics, majority rule, tree refinement, matrix representation with parsimony   \\textbf{MSC:} C92B05, 05C05",

    "abstract": "Effects like selection in evolution as well as fertility inheritance in the development of populations can lead to a higher degree of asymmetry in evolutionary trees than expected under a null hypothesis. To identify and quantify such influences, various balance indices were proposed in the phylogenetic literature and have been in use for decades.   However, so far no balance index was based on the number of \\emph{symmetry nodes}, even though symmetry nodes play an important role in other areas of mathematical phylogenetics and despite the fact that symmetry nodes are a quite natural way to measure balance or symmetry of a given tree.   The aim of this manuscript is thus twofold: First, we will introduce the \\emph{symmetry nodes index} as an index for measuring balance of phylogenetic trees and analyze its extremal properties. We also show that this index can be calculated in linear time. This new index turns out to be a generalization of a simple and well-known balance index, namely the \\emph{cherry index}, as well as a specialization of another, less established, balance index, namely \\emph{Rogers' $J$ index}. Thus, it is the second objective of the present manuscript to compare the new symmetry nodes index to these two indices and to underline its advantages. In order to do so, we will derive some extremal properties of the cherry index and Rogers' $J$ index along the way and thus complement existing studies on these indices. Moreover, we used the programming language \\textsf{R} to implement all three indices in the software package \\textsf{symmeTree}, which has been made publicly available.",

Then, we establish the first strong Harnack inequality under the aforementioned tail summability assumption. The latter is in fact naturally implied in literature, e. g., from the usual mass density boundedness (as for the Boltzmann equation without cut-off), and it reveals to be in clear accordance with the very recent counterexample by Kassmann and Weidner \\cite{KW24c}.

Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.

Galling frequency behaviour was predicted for 316L steel. Deformation of the surfaces was dominated by the surface geometry, with no significant effect due to variations in frictional models. Plastic and frictional heating were found to have a minimal effect on the deformation of the surface, with the rapid conduction of heat preventing any highly localised heating. There was no corresponding effect on the predicted galling frequency response.   Isothermal, elevated temperature conditions caused a decrease in galling resistance, driven by the temperature sensitivity of the critical resolved shear stress. The extent of deformation, as quantified by the area of plastically deformed material and plastic reach, increased with temperature. Comparisons were made with literature results for several surface amplitude and wavelength conditions. Model results compared favourably with those in the literature. However, the reduction in predicted galling resistance with elevated temperature for a fixed surface was not as severe as observations in the literature, suggesting other mechanisms (e.g. phase transformations, surface coatings and oxides) are likely important.",

The polarimetric observation of clouds CB24, CB27 and CB188 are conducted to study the magnetic field geometry of those clouds from ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital, India. These observations are combined with those of 14 further low latitude clouds available in the literature. Analyzing the polarimetric data of 17 clouds, we find that the alignment between the envelope magnetic field ($\\theta_{B}^{env}$) and Galactic plane ($\\theta_{GP}$) of the low-latitude clouds varies with their galactic longitudes ($l$). We observe a strong correlation between the longitude (\\textit{l}) and the offset ($\\theta_{off}=|\\theta_B^{env}-\\theta_{GP}|$) which shows that $\\theta_{B}^{env}$ is parallel to the Galactic plane (GP) when the clouds are situated in the region, $115^\\circ<l<250^\\circ$. However, $\\theta_{B}^{env}$ has its own local deflection irrespective of the orientation of $\\theta_{GP}$ when the clouds are at $l<100^\\circ$ and $l>250^\\circ$. To check the consistency of our results, the stellar polarization data available at Heiles (2000) catalogue are overlaid on DSS image of the clouds having mean polarization vector of field stars. The results are almost consistent with the Heiles data.

    "abstract": "High-dimensional linear regression under heavy-tailed noise or outlier corruption is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially since the robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a projected sub-gradient descent algorithm for both the sparse linear regression and low-rank linear regression problems. The algorithm is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed with a finite 1 + epsilon moment. The convergence theory is established for a general framework and its specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a surprising phenomenon of two-phase convergence. In phase one, the algorithm behaves as in typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal estimator, which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly, during phase two, the algorithm converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function, and thus a constant stepsize suffices. Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of our algorithm over prior methods.",

Human-computer interaction applications require Colloquial Tamil (CT) to make it more accessible and easy for the everyday user and, it requires Literary Tamil (LT) when information is needed in a formal written format. Continuing the use of LT alongside CT in computer aided language learning applications will both preserve LT, and provide ease of use via CT, at the same time. Hence there is a need for the conversion between LT and CT dialects, which demands as a first step, dialect identification. Dialect Identification (DID) of LT and CT is an unexplored area of research. In the current work, keeping the nuances of both these dialects in mind, five methods are explored which include two implicit methods - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); two explicit methods - Parallel Phone Recognition (PPR) and Parallel Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (P-LVCSR); two versions of the proposed explicit Unified Phone Recognition method (UPR-1 and UPR-2). These methods vary based on: the need for annotated data, the size of the unit, the way in which modelling is carried out, and the way in which the final decision is made. Even though the average duration of the test utterances is less - 4.9s for LT and 2.5s for CT - the systems performed well, offering the following identification accuracies: 87.72% (GMM), 93.97% (CNN), 89.24% (PPR), 94.21% (P-LVCSR), 88.57% (UPR-1), 93.53% (UPR-1 with P-LVCSR), 94.55% (UPR-2), and 95.61% (UPR-2 with P-LVCSR).",

    "abstract": "In ideal human computer interaction (HCI), the colloquial form of a language would be preferred by most users, since it is the form used in their day-to-day conversations. However, there is also an undeniable necessity to preserve the formal literary form. By embracing the new and preserving the old, both service to the common man (practicality) and service to the language itself (conservation) can be rendered. Hence, it is ideal for computers to have the ability to accept, process, and converse in both forms of the language, as required. To address this, it is first necessary to identify the form of the input speech, which in the current work is between literary and colloquial Tamil speech. Such a front-end system must consist of a simple, effective, and lightweight classifier that is trained on a few effective features that are capable of capturing the underlying patterns of the speech signal. To accomplish this, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) that learns the envelope of features across time, is proposed. The network is trained on a select number of handcrafted features initially, and then on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) for comparison. The handcrafted features were selected to address various aspects of speech such as the spectral and temporal characteristics, prosody, and voice quality. The features are initially analyzed by considering ten parallel utterances and observing the trend of each feature with respect to time. The proposed 1D-CNN, trained using the handcrafted features, offers an F1 score of 0.9803, while that trained on the MFCC offers an F1 score of 0.9895. In light of this, feature ablation and feature combination are explored. When the best ranked handcrafted features, from the feature ablation study, are combined with the MFCC, they offer the best results with an F1 score of 0.9946.",

Here we present the program which evaluates those expansion terms.   This Mathematica package provides two subroutines. First one performs analytical evaluation of basic one loop integrals. The second one is used to construct composite functions out of those integrals. Composite functions thus obtained are ready for numerical evaluation with literary no time consumption.",

In American English, it is often prefixed by the adjective \"cold\". On the contrary, in Italian the equivalent expression \"denaro liquido\" can be literary translated as \"liquid money\". In French the expression is equivalent with the additional factor, with respect to the rest of this discussion, that money becomes \"argent\". We have therefore two very different points of view: Is money hard and cold, or rather liquid and \"jingling\" (\"moneta sonante\")? As usual, we shall investigate this topic starting from some comics about the duck family.",

There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality.",

If the various dialects are not addressed in technological advancements like automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis, there is a chance that these dialects may disappear. Speech technology plays a role in preserving various dialects of a language from going extinct. In order to build a full fledged automatic speech recognition system that addresses various dialects, an Automatic Dialect Identification (ADI) system acting as the front end is required. This is similar to how language identification systems act as front ends to automatic speech recognition systems that handle multiple languages. The current work proposes a way to identify two popular and broadly classified Tamil dialects, namely literary and colloquial Tamil. Acoustical characteristics rather than phonetics and phonotactics are used, alleviating the requirement of language-dependant linguistic tools. Hence one major advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require an annotated corpus, hence it can be easily adapted to other languages. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features are used to perform the classification task. The experiments yielded an error rate of 12%. Vowel nasalization, as being the reason for this good performance, is discussed. The number of mixture models for the GMM is varied and the performance is analysed.",

The models have initial metallicities Z = 0.014 (solar) and Z = 0.03 (twice-solar) and initial masses 2 - 4.5 Msun, selected such as the condition C/O>1 for the formation of SiC is achieved. Because of the higher Fe abundance, the twice-solar metallicity models result in a lower number of total free neutrons released by the 13C({\\alpha},n)16O neutron source. Furthermore, the highest-mass (4 - 4.5 Msun) AGB stars of twice-solar metallicity present a milder activation of the 22Ne({\\alpha},n)25Mg neutron source than their solar metallicity counterparts, due to cooler temperatures resulting from the effect of higher opacities. They also have a lower amount of the 13C neutron source than the lower-mass models, following their smaller He-rich region. The combination of these different effects allows our AGB models of twice-solar metallicity to provide a match to the SiC data without the need to consider large variations in the features of the 13C neutron source nor neutron-capture processes different from the s process. This raises the question if the AGB parent stars of meteoritic SiC grains were in fact on average of twice-solar metallicity. The heavier-than-solar Si and Ti isotopic ratios in the same grains are in qualitative agreement with an origin in stars of super-solar metallicity because of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Further, the SiC dust mass ejected from C-rich AGB stars is predicted to significantly increase with increasing the metallicity.",

    "abstract": "Bed load transport is the movement of particles along the top of a bed through rolling, saltation, and suspension created by turbulent lift above the bed surface. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the idea that bed load transport is significant for proppant transport during hydraulic fracturing. However, scaling arguments suggest that bed load transport is only dominant in the laboratory and is negligible at the field scale. I review laboratory experiments that have been used to develop concepts of bed load transport in hydraulic fracturing. I also review the scaling arguments and laboratory results that have been used to argue that viscous drag, not bed load transport, is dominant at the field scale. I compare literature correlations for fluvial sediment transport and for pipeline slurry transport with published laboratory data on proppant transport in slot flow. The comparisons indicate that fluvial transport correlations are suitable for predicting the rate of sediment erosion due to flow of proppant-free fluid over a bed. The pipeline slurry correlations are suitable for predicting the ability of proppant that is already in suspension to flow in bed transport without settling, but only if the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot is close to unity. This can occur at the laboratory scale, but not in the field. The comparison indicates that at low rates of proppant flow, the equilibrium bed height in a laboratory proppant transport experiment can be predicted from pipeline slurry correlations. However, as the volumetric flow rate and the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of the pipeline slurry correlations breaks down. Laboratory experiments using higher volumetric flow rate indicate that bed load transport rates are too low to be significant at the field scale, even if the flow velocity is very high.",

The goal is to study the influence of geometry, and concentration of reinforcing nanographene sheet (NGS) on interfacial properties and elastic constants such as bulk Young's modulus, and shear modulus of Gr-Ep nanocomposites. The most typical cross-linked configuration was obtained in order to use in further simulations. The mechanical properties of this cross-linked structure were determined using MD simulations and the results were verified with those available in literatures. Graphene with different aspect ratios and concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%) were considered in order to construct amorphous unit cells of Gr-Ep nanocomposites. The Gr-Ep nanocomposites system undergoes NVT (constant number of atoms, volume and temperature) and NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure and temperature) ensemble with applied uniform strain field during MD simulation to obtain bulk Young's modulus and shear modulus. The stress-strain response was also evaluated for both amorphous and crystalline unit cells of Gr-Ep system under uni-axial deformation. The cohesive and pullout force vs. displacement response were determined for graphenes with different size. Hence as primary goal of this work, a parametric study using MD simulation was conducted for characterizing interfacial properties and elastic constants with different NGS aspect rations and volume fractions. The MD simulation results show reasonable agreement with available published data in the literature.",

In real-world financial markets, speed is known to heavily influence the design of automated trading algorithms, with the generally accepted wisdom that faster is better. Here, we introduce increasingly realistic models of trading speed and profile the computation times of a suite of eminent trading algorithms from the literature. Results demonstrate that: (a) trading performance is impacted by speed, but faster is not always better; (b) the Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) algorithm, until recently considered the most dominant trading strategy in the literature, is outperformed by the simplistic Shaver (SHVR) strategy - shave one tick off the current best bid or ask - when relative computation times are accurately simulated.",

Regarding quantum physics, it has been only in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature resulted in a set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial invitation, whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and unpretentious presentation, the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to cosmological settings. Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details (namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing. Subsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional calculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn (to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that may affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of minisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements, we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard cosmology. In summary, the subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith proposed, merely realized in terms of an open program constituted by several challenges.",

High-order summation-by-part operators were used at the cylinder boundary, and both bi-linear Lagrangian and bi-quadratic spline interpolation was used to communicate between the background grid and the body-conformal cylindrical grid. The performance of the overset grid method was assessed to benchmark cases of steady and unsteady flows past a cylinder. For steady flow at low Reynolds number, high-order accuracy was achieved for velocity components. Results for flow in the vortex shedding regime showed good agreement to the literature. The method was also applied to particle-laden flow simulations, where spherical point particles were inserted upstream of the cylinder. These inertial particles were convected towards and (possibly) past the cylinder. The simulations reproduced data from the literature at a significantly reduced cost, revealing that the previously published DNS data is less accurate than assumed for particles with very small Stokes numbers.",

To address this gap in the literature we present a novel modeling framework that addresses a number of topical challenges and open questions in the psychological literature on modeling dynamic processes. First, how can we model and forecast ILD when the length of individual time series and the number of variables collected are roughly equivalent, or when time series lengths are shorter than what is typically required for time series analyses? Second, how can we best take advantage of the cross-sectional (between-person) information inherent to most ILD scenarios while acknowledging individuals differ both quantitatively (e.g. in parameter magnitude) and qualitatively (e.g. in structural dynamics)? Despite the acknowledged between-person heterogeneity in many psychological processes is it possible to leverage group-level information to support improved forecasting at the individual level? In the remainder of the manuscript, we attempt to address these and other pressing questions relevant to the forecasting of multiple-subject ILD.",

This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. Many articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.",

However, species identity error almost occurs in each species survey and seriously reduces the accuracy of observed, singleton, and doubleton richness in turns to influence the behavior of richness estimator. Therefore, to estimate the true richness, the biased collected data due to species identity error should be modified before processing the richness estimation work. In the manuscript, we propose a new approach to correct the bias of richness estimation due to species identity error. First, a species list inventory from a subplot obtained by the investigator was used to estimate the species identity error rate. Then, we can correct the biased observed, singleton, and doubleton richness of the raw sampling data from the interesting area. Finally, the richness estimators proposed in the literature could be supplied to get the more correct estimates based on adjusted observed data. To investigate the behavior of the proposed method, we performed simulations by generating data sets from various species models with different species identity error rates. For the purpose of illustration, the real data was supplied to demonstrate our proposed approach. A presence/absence weeds species was surveyed in the organic farmland located at Soft Bridge County in the North of Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) was proposed in literature to obviate the requirement of drift dynamics in adaptive dynamic programming framework. Most of the online IRL schemes in literature require two sets of neural network (NNs), known as actor-critic NN and an initial stabilizing controller. Recently, for RL-based robust tracking this requirement of initial stabilizing controller and dual-approximator structure could be obviated by using a modified gradient descent-based update law containing a stabilizing term with critic-only structure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no study on leveraging such stabilizing term in IRL algorithm framework to solve optimal trajectory tracking problems for continuous time nonlinear systems with actuator constraints. To this end a novel update law leveraging the stabilizing term along with variable gain gradient descent in IRL framework is presented in this paper. With these modifications, the IRL tracking controller can be implemented using only critic NN, while no initial stabilizing controller is required. Another salient feature of the presented update law is its variable learning rate, which scales the pace of learning based on instantaneous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman error and rate of variation of Lyapunov function along the system trajectories. The augmented system states and NN weight errors are shown to possess uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) stability under the presented update law and achieve a tighter residual set. This update law is validated on a full 6-DoF nonlinear model of UAV for attitude control.",

Previous works defined an `Easily Retrievable Object' (ERO) as any Near-Earth Object (NEO) which is retrievable using these invariant manifolds with an impulsive $\\Delta v$ of less than $500$ m/s. We extend the previous literature by analysing the Pareto fronts for the EROs discovered for the first time, using high-performance computing to lift optimisation constraints used in previous literature, and modifying the method used to filter unsuitable NEOs from the NEO catalogue. In doing so, we can demonstrate that EROs have approximately the same transfer cost for almost any possible transfer time, including single-impulse transfers, which could offer significant flexibility to mission designers. We also identify $44$ EROs, of which $27$ are new, and improve on previously-known transfer solutions by up to $443$ m/s, including $17$ new capture trajectories with $\\Delta v$ costs of less than $100$ m/s.",

One of the most well-known and widely studied problems has been the estimation of the quadratic variation of the continuous component of an It\\^o semimartingale with jumps. Several rate- and variance-efficient estimators have been proposed in the literature when the jump component is of bounded variation. However, to date, very few methods can deal with jumps of unbounded variation. By developing new high-order expansions of the truncated moments of a locally stable L\\'evy process, we propose a new rate- and variance-efficient volatility estimator for a class of It\\^o semimartingales whose jumps behave locally like those of a stable L\\'evy process with Blumenthal-Getoor index $Y\\in (1,8/5)$ (hence, of unbounded variation). The proposed method is based on a two-step debiasing procedure for the truncated realized quadratic variation of the process and can also cover the case $Y<1$. Our Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the method outperforms other efficient alternatives in the literature in the setting covered by our theoretical framework.",

Understanding the impact of AM process conditions on the microstructure evolution and the resulting mechanical properties of the printed part is an active area of research. At the meltpool scale, the thermo-fluidic governing equations have been extensively modeled in the literature to understand the meltpool conditions and the thermal gradients in its vicinity. In many phenomena governed by partial differential equations, dimensional analysis and identification of important dimensionless numbers can provide significant insights into the process dynamics. In this context, a novel strategy using dimensional analysis and the method of linear least squares regression to numerically investigate the thermo-fluidic governing equations of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion AM process is presented in this work. First, the governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, and the model predictions are validated by comparing with experimentally estimated cooling rates, and with numerical results from the literature. Then, through dimensional analysis, an important dimensionless quantity - interpreted as a measure of heat absorbed by the powdered material and the meltpool, is identified. This dimensionless measure of heat absorbed, along with classical dimensionless quantities such as Peclet, Marangoni, and Stefan numbers, is used to investigate advective transport in the meltpool for different alloys. Further, the framework is used to study the variations of thermal gradients and the solidification cooling rate. Important correlations linking meltpool morphology and microstructure evolution related variables with classical dimensionless numbers are the key contribution of this work.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting (IF), caloric restriction (CR) and exercise. Improved neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis (NSPAN) are essential examples of these neurotrophic effects. The importance in this respect of the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone bodies as cellular fuel has been highlighted. More recently, calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs; resveratrol and other polyphenols in particular) have been investigated thoroughly in relation to NSPAN. In the narrative review sections of this manuscript, recent findings on these essential functions are synthesized and the most important molecules involved are presented. The most researched signaling pathways (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, GSK3$\\beta$, ULK, MAPK, PGC-1$\\alpha$, NF-$\\kappa$B, sirtuins, Notch, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) and processes (e.g., anti-inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis) that support or thwart neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis are then briefly presented. This provides an accessible entry point to the literature. In the annotated bibliography section of this contribution, brief summaries are provided of about 30 literature reviews relating to the neurotrophic effects of interest in relation to IF, CR, CRMs and exercise. Most of the selected reviews address these essential functions from the perspective of healthier aging (sometimes discussing epigenetic factors) and the reduction of the risk for neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease) and depression or the improvement of cognitive function.",

However, most high-performance semitransparent cells reported to date are based on materials that have shown high power conversion efficiency for opaque devices. We therefore present a model to assess the optimum efficiency and transparency for a specific donor and acceptor band gap. The absorption characteristics of both donor and acceptor are modeled with spectral data of typical absorber materials from the literature which are adjusted to achieve the desired band gap value. The results show three distinct regions of high light utilization efficiency if the photopic curve is employed as a weighting function (corresponding to window applications), and a broad maximum for the plant action spectrum as a weighting function (corresponding to greenhouse applications). When comparing these findings to reported experimental values, it is evident that the band gaps of the materials used for the experimental studies do not correspond to the maxima identified by our simulation model. The analysis of the energy levels of molecules recorded in the literature confirms that all band gaps and therefore all LUE maxima are chemically feasible so that the performance of semitransparent OSCs can be further improved by designing materials with optimized absorption spectra.",

Efficiently harvesting low-grade heat could be a promising step toward carbon neutrality. Recent developments of ionic thermoelectrics (i-TE) with giant thermopower have provoked intensive interest in using ions as energy and charge carriers for efficient thermal energy harvesting. However, current literature primarily focuses on improving thermopower only, while the ion transport and thermodynamics affecting the efficiencies have been largely neglected. This review article clarifies the fundamentals of electrochemistry and thermodynamics for developing highly efficient i-TE devices. Two major types of i-TE devices, thermo-ionic capacitors (TIC) and thermogalvanic cells (TGC), are discussed in detail. The article analyzes the methods of enhancing ionic thermopower in the literature by taking an entropic point of view. We also derived modified thermoelectric factor Z for both TICs and TGCs that fully incorporate the dynamics of ion transport and electrochemical reactions. Recent developments of hybrid devices showing improved efficiencies, power density, and multifunctionality are reviewed. Finally, we comment on the remaining challenges and provide an outlook on future directions.",

In particular, we consider the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation, which is the McKean-Vlasov (MKV) PDE, perturbed by additive trace class noise. As is well-known, the MKV PDE can be obtained as mean field limit of the empirical measure of a stochastic system of interacting particles, where particles are subject to independent sources of noise. There is now a natural question, which is the one we consider and answer in this paper: can we obtain the SMKV equation, i.e. additive perturbations of the MKV PDE, as limit of interacting particle systems? It turns out that, in order to obtain the SMKV equation, one needs to study weighted empirical measures of particles, where the particles evolve according to a system of SDEs with independent noise, while the weights are time evolving and subject to common noise. The work of this manuscript therefore complements and contributes to various streams of literature, in particular: i) much attention in the community is currently devoted to obtaining SPDEs as scaling limits of appropriate dynamics; this paper contributes to a complementary stream, which is devoted to obtaining representations of SPDE through limits of empirical measures of interacting particle systems; ii) since the literature on limits of weighted empirical measures is often constrained to the case of static (random or deterministic) weights, this paper contributes to further expanding this line of research to the case of time-evolving weights.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \\enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \\enquote{correct} tree than on others.   A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $n\\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $n\\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal.",

In this short paper, we revisit this problem and obtain a new shorter proof of existing strong quantitative convergence estimates (in particular, $L^2$ estimates) and weak convergence estimates in terms of $n$ (the parameter associated with the separation of scales). In particular, we obtain the rate of $n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ in the strong convergence estimates and the rate of $n^{-1}$ for weak convergence estimate which are already known to be optimal in the literature. We achieve this using nonlinear filtering theory where we represent the evolution of faster diffusion in terms of its conditional distribution given the slower diffusion. We then use the well-known Kushner-Stratanovich equation which gives the evolution of the conditional distribution of the fast diffusion given the slow diffusion and establish that this conditional distribution approaches the invariant measure of the ``frozen\" diffusion (obtained by freezing the slow variable in the evolution equation of the fast diffusion). At the heart of the analysis lies a key estimate of a weighted total variation distance between a generic measure and the unique invariant measure (of the ``frozen\" diffusion). This estimate is in terms of the operator norm of the dual of the infinitesimal generator of the ``frozen\" diffusion.",

This paper describes our attempt to close that gap by wrapping the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) as a scriptable S-Lang module. Using PVM within ISIS, the Interactive Spectral Interpretation System, we've distributed a number of representive calculations over a network of 25+ CPUs to achieve dramatic reductions in execution times. We discuss how the approach applies to a wide class of modeling problems, outline our efforts to make it more transparent for common use, and note its growing importance in the context of the large, multi-wavelength datasets used in modern analysis.",

Local Lyapunov exponents, however, are more directly relevant to predictability. The difference between the local and global Lyapunov exponents, the large variations of local exponents over an attractor, and the saturation of error growth near the size of the attractor---all result in non-exponential scalings in errors at both short and long prediction times, sometimes even obscuring evidence of exponential growth. Failure to observe exponential error scaling cannot rule out deterministic chaos as an explanation. We demonstrate a simple model that quantitatively predicts observed error scaling from the local Lyapunov exponents, for both short and surprisingly long times. We comment on the relevance to atmospheric predictability as studied in the meteorological literature.",

Upon La-doping, the c-axis contracts but the structure remains stable up to the critical concentration xc, above which the crystals contain the pure Bi2(Sr,La)2CuO6 phase. The reduction of the superconducting transition temperature follows a linear relation, Tc(x)=Tc(0) (1-x/xc), with xc=0.3 being consistent with the structure data. This and a comparison with literature data on Pr3+- (xc>>0.65) and Y3+-doping (xc=1) indicate an intimate relation between structural and superconducting stability in the 2212 phase. Besides the widely discussed hole-filling effect, the structural instability due to the substitution of large La3+ for Ca2+ is considered to be another contribution to Tc suppression in this system.",

QCD equalities among octet baryon magnetic moments lead to a determination of the disconnected sea-quark contribution to nucleon magnetic moments, which is the most reliable determination in the literature. Matching QCD equalities to recent calculations of decuplet baryon magnetic moments in chiral perturbation theory (ChiPT) reveals an equivalence between ChiPT to order $p^2$ and the simple quark model with an explicit disconnected sea-quark contribution. New insights into SU(3)-flavor symmetry breaking, sea contributions and constituent quark composition are obtained. The strangeness contribution to nucleon magnetic moments is found to be large at $G_M^s(0) = -0.75 \\pm 0.30\\ \\mu_N$. The QCD equalities must be followed by any model which hopes to capture the essence of nonperturbative QCD. Not all models are in accord with these symmetries.",

The abscissae of the Gaussian summation have a very interesting asymptotic distribution function with a (cusp) singularity. We apply the Gaussian summation technique to two problems which have been discussed in the literature. We find that the Gaussian summation has an extremely rapid convergence rate for the Hardy-Littlewood sum for a large range of parameters. For functions which are smooth but have a large scale, a, the error of Gaussian Summation shows exponential convergence as a function of summation points. The Gaussian summation achieves a given accuracy with a number of points proportional to the sqrt of the large scale whereas other summation schemes require at least a number of function evaluations proportional to the scale.",

In this work, we present a sound multivariate statistical approach, including feature spaces and multivariate statistical analysis (especially canonical projections), in order to characterize several Internet models while considering a larger set of relevant measurements. We apply such a methodology to determine, among nine complex networks models, which are those most compatible with the real Internet data (on the autonomous systems level) considering a set of 21 network measurements. We conclude that none of the considered models can reproduce the Internet topology with high accuracy.",

In the existing literature, relatively little attention has been given to the influence of neuron shape on the overall connectivity and dynamics of the emerging networks. The current work addresses this issue by considering simplified neuronal shapes consisting of circular regions (soma/axons) with spokes (dendrites). Networks are grown by placing these patterns randomly in the 2D plane and establishing connections whenever a piece of dendrite falls inside an axon. Several topological and dynamical properties of the resulting graph are measured, including the degree distribution, clustering coefficients, symmetry of connections, size of the largest connected component, as well as three hierarchical measurements of the local topology. By varying the number of processes of the individual basic patterns, we can quantify relationships between the individual neuronal shape and the topological and dynamical features of the networks. Integrate-and-fire dynamics on these networks is also investigated with respect to transient activation from a source node, indicating that long-range connections play an important role in the propagation of avalanches.",

We propose that all 4 variants are moire structures that can be classified using simple geometric rules involving periodic and quasi-periodic structural motifs. In addition, LEEM reveals that linear defects form in the graphene sheets during cooling from the synthesis temperature.

Methods in the existing statistical literature cannot be used for testing Granger causality, since under the null hypothesis the model becomes unidentifiable. Measurement error effects on parameter estimates were evaluated by using computational simulations. The results show that the proposed approach produces empirical false positive rates close to the adopted nominal level (even for small samples) and has a good performance around the null hypothesis.

We demonstrate that there are three classes of the relative equilibria, which we call \"cylindrical\", \"inclined co-planar\", and \"conic\" precessions, respectively. Moreover, we also show that in the case of conic precession, although the relative orbit is circular, the point-mass and the mass center of the body move in different parallel planes.

In order to do this, we first prove that there always exist some special Gauss coordinates for which the conserved linear and angular three-momenta vanish. This allows us to consider the case of creatable universes (the universes whose proper 4-momenta vanish) in a consistent way, which is the main interest of the paper. When applied to the Friedmann-Lema{\\^{\\i}}tre-Robertson-Walker case, perturbed or not, our formalism leads to previous results, according to most literature on the subject. Some future work that should be done is mentioned.",

Technically we rely on the (numerical) exact diagonalization of the system's Hamilitonian. From the perspective of different localization measures we confirm and extend the picture of the emergence of delocalized states with increasing correlations. Beside these studies a definition for multi-particle localization is proposed. In the case of two interacting bosons we observe a sensitivity of localization with respect to the range of the particle-particle interaction and insensitivity to the coupling's sign, which should stimulate new theoretical approaches and experimental investigations with e.g. dipolar cold quantum gases.   This revised manuscript is much more explicit compared to the initial version of the paper. Major extensions have been applied to Sects.

Consequently, the corresponding field theory can be renormalized by a simple shift of the spectral function appearing in the spectral action.

In our present study we use this factorization technique to address the problem of finding solutions of a system of general two-coupled Li\\'enard type nonlinear differential equations. We describe a generic algorithm to identify specific classes of Li\\'enard type systems for which solutions may be found. We demonstrate this method by identifying a class of two-coupled equations for which the particular solution can be found by solving a Bernoulli equation. This class of equations include coupled generalization of the modified Emden equation.

It is also found that the leading order contributions for interactions between axions and other species vanish, which implies that the axion BEC does not give any significant modifications on standard cosmological parameters.",

We prove that this asymptotic for the minimum queue length is exactly geometric, and its decay rate is the $k$-th power of the traffic intensity of the corresponding $k$ server queues with a single waiting line. For this, we use two formulations, a quasi-birth-and-death (QBD for short) process and a reflecting random walk on the boundary of the $k+1$-dimensional orthant. The QBD process is typically used in the literature for studying the JSQ with 2 parallel queues, but the random walk also plays a key roll in our arguments, which enables us to use the existing results on tail asymptotics for the QBD process.",

The splitting structure is defined without recourse to coordinates or frames. This is noteworthy since, in much of the prevalent literature, observers are identified with adapted coordinates and frames. Among the benefits of the approach is a concise and insightful classification of splitting structures that is juxtaposed to a classification of observers. The application of the framework to the Ehrenfest paradox and Schiff's \"Question in General Relativity\" further illustrates the advantages of the framework, enabling a compact, yet profound analysis of the problems at hand.",

A system that couples the two equations to model the interaction of long and short waves seems attractive and such a system has been studied over the last decades. We evaluate the validity of this system, discussing two main problems. First, only the system coupling the linear Schr\\\"odinger equation with KdV has been derived in the literature. Second, the time variables appearing in the equations are of a different order. It appears that in the manuscripts that study the coupled NLS-KdV system, an assumption has been made that the coupled system can be derived, justifying its mathematical study. In fact, this is true even for the papers where the asymptotic derivation with the problems described above is presented. In addition to discussing these inconsistencies, we present some alternative systems describing the interaction of long and short waves.",

    "abstract": "The explicit filtering method for large eddy simulation (LES,) which comprises integration of the governing equations without any added terms for sub-grid-scale modeling, and the application of a low-pass filter to transported fields, is discussed. The shapes of filter response functions of numerical schemes for spatial derivatives and the explicit filter, that have been used for several LES, are examined. Generally, these are flat (no filtering) over a range of low wavenumbers, and then fall off over a small range of the highest represented wavenumbers. It is argued that this high wavenumber part can be viewed as a spectral buffer analogous to physical buffer (or sponge) zones used near outflow boundaries. The monotonic convergence of this approach to a direct numerical simulation, and the shifting of the spectral buffer to larger wavenumbers as the represented spectral range is increased, without altering the low wavenumber part of solutions, is demonstrated with LES of two sample flows. Connections to other widely used methods---the Smagorinsky model, MILES and another ILES---are also explained.",

In this work, we study the performance of l1-minimization when these estimates are not available, providing robust recovery guarantees for quadratically constrained basis pursuit and random sampling in bounded orthonormal systems. Several applications of this work are approximation of high-dimensional functions, infinite-dimensional sparse regularization for inverse problems, and fast algorithms for non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",

Recurrence properties can properly be studied using recurrence plots, a methodology based on binary matrices where trajec- tories in phase space of dynamical systems are evaluated against other embedded trajectory. Our novel entropy methodology has several advantages compared to the traditional recurrence entropy defined in the literature, namely, the correct evaluation of the chaoticity level of the signal, the weak dependence on parameters, correct evaluation of periodic time series properties and more sensitivity to noise level of time series. Furthermore, the new entropy quantifier developed in this manuscript also fixes inconsistent results of the traditional recurrence entropy concept, reproducing classical results with novel insights.",

These are the so-called islands of stability. Among them, geons play the role of purely gravitational excitations of AdS space-time.   In this manuscript, we tackle the problem of the numerical construction of several families of asymptotically AdS geons. We are able to definitely demonstrate the existence of the so-called excited geons, a point that was the subject to a lively debate in the literature.

The possible effects caused by the existence of a common time-like coordinate between the compact dimensions and our 3-dimensional hypersurface are investigated. The higher dimensional Friedmann-Like equations of the mentioned model are achieved. The continuity equation is reached at the special case of 3+4+1-dimensional metric. It is shown that not only the existence of the extra dimensions itself but also the pressure difference between the 3-dimensional hypersurface and the compact dimensions might get probed on the hypersurface as an additive source of gravity with the same behavior as baryonic matter. Furthermore, the relation between the coupling constant of the higher-dimensional universe and the Newton's constant of gravitation is investigated to reach an estimated limit for it.

In this paper, we propose a simple frequency-dependent bulk viscosity model which, under such assumptions, accurately captures wave attenuation rates from infrasonic to ultrasonic frequencies in Navier--Stokes and lattice Boltzmann simulations. The proposed model can be extended to any gas mixture for which molecular relaxation timescales and attenuation measurements are available. The performance of the model is assessed for air by varying the base temperature, pressure, relative humidity $h_r$, and acoustic frequency. Since the vibrational relaxation timescales of oxygen and nitrogen are a function of humidity, for certain frequencies an intermediate value of $h_r$ can be found which maximizes $\\mu_B$. The contribution to bulk viscosity due to rotational relaxation is verified to be a function of temperature, confirming recent findings in the literature. While $\\mu_B$ decreases with higher frequencies, its effects on wave attenuation become more significant, as shown via a dimensionless analysis. The proposed bulk viscosity model is designed for frequency-domain linear acoustic formulations but is also extensible to time-domain simulations of narrow-band frequency content flows.",

The additional term is essential in certain antiferromagnets where magnetic moments order in antiparallel ferromagnetic planes characterized by a normal axis. In such antiferromagnets, we predict that the magnetostrictive strain depends on the direction of the normal axis. Our findings are relevant for materials such as NiO and CoO, where there is a new spin-structure dependent strain, but not in RbMnF$_3$.

In the context of incompressible/weakly-compressible fluid flow, the SPH method is more accurate when the particle distribution is uniform. Hence, for the time accurate simulation of flow in the presence of complex boundaries, one must have both an accurate boundary discretization as well as a uniform distribution of particles to initialize the simulation. This process of obtaining an initial uniform distribution of particles is called \"particle packing\". In this paper, various particle packing algorithms present in the literature are implemented and compared. An improved SPH-based algorithm is proposed which produces uniform particle distributions of both the fluid and solid domains in two and three dimensions.

This property is not true in general, and the issue of quantifying the lack of scalability remains an open problem. Even though heuristic explanations are given in the literature, a rigorous and systematic analysis is still missing. In this short manuscript, we provide a first rigorous result that precisely quantifies the lack of scalability of the classical one-level parallel Schwarz method for the solution to the one-dimensional Laplace equation. Our analysis technique provides a possible roadmap for a systematic extension to more realistic problems in higher dimensions.",

Specifically, the decision space which can be split into several blocks of convex set is considered. We present a distributed block coordinate descent (DSBCD) method in which for each node, information communication with other agents and a block Bregman projection are performed in each iteration. In contrast to existing work, we do not require the projection is operated on the whole decision space. Instead, in each step, distributed projection procedure is performed on only one random block. The explicit formulation of the convergence level depending on random projection probabilities and network parameters is achieved. An expected $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate is achieved. In addition, we obtain an explicit $\\mathcal{O}(b^2/\\epsilon^2)$ complexity bound with target accuracy $\\epsilon$ and characteristic constant factor $b$. The complexity with dependency on $\\epsilon$ and $b$ is shown to be the best known in this literature.",

In this manuscript we propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading infections. This model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict the total number of cases as a function of time.

The main aim of this manuscript is to provide some sufficient criteria for treebasedness by reducing phylogenetic networks to related graph structures. While it is generally known that deciding whether a network is treebased is NP-complete, one of these criteria, namely edgebasedness, can be verified in linear time. Surprisingly, the class of edgebased networks is closely related to a well-known family of graphs, namely the class of generalized series parallel graphs, and we will explore this relationship in full detail. Additionally, we introduce further classes of treebased networks and analyze their relationships.",

The values of the parameters describing the interactions, namely the refractive indices, dielectric constants, Hamaker constant and cut-off length, are extracted from literature or are experimentally determined by independent experiments, including static light scattering to determine the second virial coefficient.

Finally, these ideas are extended to show that a class of random general QCQPs has exact semidefinite relaxations with high probability as long as the number of constraints grows no faster than a fixed polynomial in the number of variables.

This limits meaningful comparisons between algorithms, and further, limits the ability of any algorithm to classify verbal autopsy deaths by cause in a way that is widely generalizable across regions and through time. Verbal autopsy algorithms utilize a variety of information to describe the relationship between verbal autopsy symptoms and causes of death - called symptom-cause information (SCI).

Furthermore, we determine the quantum yield of this complex biochemical process after setting the electrochemical potentials to values well established in the literature. The present work suggests that the theory of quantum open systems can successfully push forward our theoretical understanding of complex biological systems working close to the quantum/classical boundary.",

    "abstract": "Reconnections of coherent filamentary structures play a key role in the dynamics of fluids, redistributing energy and helicity among the length scales, triggering dissipative effects and inducing fine-scale mixing. Unlike ordinary (classical) fluids where vorticity is a continuous field, in superfluid helium and in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) vorticity takes the form of isolated quantised vortex lines, which are conceptually easier to study. New experimental techniques now allow visualisation of individual vortex reconnections in helium and condensates. It has long being suspected that reconnections obey universal laws, particularly a universal scaling with time of the minimum distance between vortices $\\delta$. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of this scaling across a range of scenarios relevant to superfluid helium and trapped condensates, combining our own numerical simulations with the previous results in the literature. We reveal that the scaling exhibit two distinct fundamental regimes: a $\\delta \\sim t^{1/2}$ scaling arising from the mutual interaction of the reconnecting strands and a $\\delta \\sim t$ scaling when extrinsic factors drive the individual vortices.",

Although interzeolite transformations enable selective crystallization, their design lacks predictions to connect framework similarity and experimental observations. Here, computational and theoretical tools are combined to data-mine, analyze and explain interzeolite relations. It is observed that building units are weak predictors of topology interconversion and insufficient to explain intergrowth. By introducing a supercell-invariant metric that compares crystal structures using graph theory, we show that topotactic and reconstructive (diffusionless) transformations occur only between graph-similar pairs. Furthermore, all known instances of intergrowth occur between either structurally-similar or graph-similar frameworks. Backed with exhaustive literature results, we identify promising pairs for realizing novel diffusionless transformations and intergrowth. Hundreds of low-distance pairs are identified among known zeolites, and thousands of hypothetical frameworks are connected to known zeolites counterparts. The theory opens a venue to understand and control zeolite polymorphism.",

Moreover, we address the concern brought up on the validity of the master equation in the deep quantum regime, and show that our noise-enhanced synchronization differs from previous literature. Through numerical examples, we also demonstrate that the choice of ansatz, while appearing inconsistent, does not lead to erroneous conclusions. Lastly, we expound on the physics of noise-boosted synchronization, and show that it is indeed a genuine feature unique to the deep quantum regime. However, we note that single photon dissipation is a more accurate term, and will move to using that.",

An overall agreement of the obtained results with the existing literature for the jet flow proves the effectiveness of the new closure equations.

The underlying problem is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear optimization problem which does not have a trivial solution. To solve the problem, having fixed the consumed power of each user, and assuming low co-channel interference region, the sub-channel allocation problem is reformulate into a more mathematically tractable problem which is shown can be tackled through the so-called Hungarian algorithm.

An online adaptive learning mechanism is developed to tackle the above limitations and provide a generalized solution platform for a class of tracking control problems. This scheme minimizes the tracking errors and optimizes the overall dynamical behavior using simultaneous linear feedback control strategies. Reinforcement learning approaches based on value iteration processes are adopted to solve the underlying Bellman optimality equations. The resulting control strategies are updated in real time in an interactive manner without requiring any information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. Means of adaptive critics are employed to approximate the optimal solving value functions and the associated control strategies in real time.

This is a difficult task because SAR images are contaminated with speckle noise. Different point estimation strategies under multiplicative noise are discussed in the literature. It is important to assess the quality of such point estimates and to also perform inference under a given confidence level. This can be achieved through interval parameter estimation. To that end, we propose bootstrap-based edge confidence interval. The relative merits of the different inference strategies are compared using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that interval edge estimation can be used to assess the accuracy of an edge point estimate. They also show that interval estimates can be quite accurate and that they can indicate the absence of an edge. In order to illustrate interval edge estimation, we also analyze a real dataset.",

The first contribution is calculated from the first principles of statistical mechanics with an account of MOF symmetry. By minimizing the obtained free energy and solving the resulting system of equations, we obtain the local electric field and the parameter of the unit cell (angle $\\alpha$). The paper also studies the cross-section area of the unit cell and the polarization as functions of the external electric field.

The novel concepts of the direct, indirect and transfer (total) transactions between any two sectors are introduced, and the corresponding requirements matrices and coefficients are systematically formulated relative to both final demands and gross outputs based on the system decomposition theory in the present manuscript. It is demonstrated theoretically and through illustrative examples that the proposed requirements matrices accurately define and correctly quantify the corresponding direct, indirect, and total interactions and relationships.

This is related to the thermo diffusion effect which is quantified by the ionic heat of transport and the thermal diffusion coefficient. When a solution is confined between two metallic electrodes with different temperatures, it is expected to measure the electrostatic potential difference due to the thermoelectric field. We performed experiments in aqueous electrolyte solutions, and our results show that a thermoelectric field appears instantly in the solution as the temperature difference between the electrodes stabilizes. This field arises from the trend to separate both ionic charges in the temperature gradient. The experimental results also show that a slow change in the potential difference is observed, which is related to thermodiffusion in the entire cell. These results are important to understand how the thermoelectric response can be optimized, given the broad interest in the literature to generate thermoelectric energy from thermoelectric cells.",

In [11], the authors analyzed the spectral properties of the matrices produced by the ALIF method, in order to study its stability.

Both approaches serve as valuable extensions to the existing literature on the gradient boosting framework and random forests. A Monte Carlo simulation, in which tree-shaped data sets with different numbers of final partitions are built, suggests that there are several scenarios where \\emph{Random Boost} and \\emph{Random$^2$ Forest} can improve the prediction performance of conventional hierarchical boosting and random forest approaches. The new algorithms appear to be especially successful in cases where there are merely a few high-order interactions in the generated data. In addition, our simulations suggest that our random tree depth injection approach can improve computation time by up to 40%, while at the same time the performance losses in terms of prediction accuracy turn out to be minor or even negligible in most cases.",

In this work we present a variational quantum algorithm called Variational Quantum Fisher Information Estimation (VQFIE) to address this task. By estimating lower and upper bounds on the QFI, based on bounding the fidelity, VQFIE outputs a range in which the actual QFI lies. This result can then be used to variationally prepare the state that maximizes the QFI, for the application of quantum sensing. In contrast to previous approaches, VQFIE does not require knowledge of the explicit form of the sensor dynamics. We simulate the algorithm for a magnetometry setup and demonstrate the tightening of our bounds as the state purity increases. For this example, we compare our bounds to literature bounds and show that our bounds are tighter.",

Incorporating historical data in the analysis of the current study is of great importance, as it can help to gain more information, improve efficiency, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of treatment. Enlightened by the unit information prior (UIP) concept in the reference Bayesian test, we propose a new informative prior called UIP from an information perspective that can adaptively borrow information from multiple historical datasets. We consider both binary and continuous data and also extend the new UIP methods to linear regression settings. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our method is comparable to other commonly used informative priors, while the interpretation of UIP is intuitive and its implementation is relatively easy. One distinctive feature of UIP is that its construction only requires summary statistics commonly reported in the literature rather than the patient-level data. By applying our UIP methods to phase III clinical trials for investigating the efficacy of memantine in Alzheimer's disease, we illustrate its ability of adaptively borrowing information from multiple historical datasets in the real application.",

Using a recently introduced quantitative measure for Fock-space localization computed from the density distributions, the occupation distance, we systematically study its scaling behavior across delocalozation transitions and identify critical points from scaling collapses of numerical data. Excellent agreement with literature results is found for the critical disorder strengths of noninteracting fermions, such as the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\\'e and the three-dimensional Anderson model. We observe a distinctively different scaling behavior in the case of interacting fermions with random disorder consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

The main new claim in KMS is that the short-ranged model does not support an MBL DTC phase. We show that, even for the parameter values they consider and the system sizes they study, the claim is an artifact of an unusual choice of range for the crucial plots. Conducting a standard finite-size scaling analysis on the same data strongly suggests that the system is in fact a many-body localized (MBL) discrete time crystal (DTC). Furthermore, we have carried out additional simulations at larger scales, and provide an analytic argument, which fully support the conclusions of our original paper. We also show that the effect of boundary conditions, described as essential by KMS, is exactly what one would expect, with boundary effects decreasing with increasing system size. The other points in KMS are either a rehashing of points already in the literature (for the long-ranged model) or are refuted by a proper finite-size scaling analysis.",

    "abstract": "Various goodness-of-fit tests are designed based on the so-called information matrix equivalence: if the assumed model is correctly specified, two information matrices that are derived from the likelihood function are equivalent. In the literature, this principle has been established for the likelihood function with fully observed data, but it has not been verified under the likelihood for censored data. In this manuscript, we prove the information matrix equivalence in the framework of semiparametric copula models for multivariate censored survival data. Based on this equivalence, we propose an information ratio (IR) test for the specification of the copula function. The IR statistic is constructed via comparing consistent estimates of the two information matrices. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the IR statistic and propose a parametric bootstrap procedure for the finite-sample $P$-value calculation. The performance of the IR test is investigated via a simulation study and a real data example.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary relationships among organisms have traditionally been represented using rooted phylogenetic trees. However, due to reticulate processes such as hybridization or lateral gene transfer, evolution cannot always be adequately represented by a phylogenetic tree, and rooted phylogenetic networks that describe such complex processes have been introduced as a generalization of rooted phylogenetic trees. In fact, estimating rooted phylogenetic networks from genomic sequence data and analyzing their structural properties is one of the most important tasks in contemporary phylogenetics. Over the last two decades, several subclasses of rooted phylogenetic networks (characterized by certain structural constraints) have been introduced in the literature, either to model specific biological phenomena or to enable tractable mathematical and computational analyses. In the present manuscript, we provide a thorough review of these network classes, as well as provide a biological interpretation of the structural constraints underlying these networks where possible. In addition, we discuss how imposing structural constraints on the network topology can be used to address the scalability and identifiability challenges faced in the estimation of phylogenetic networks from empirical data.",

The statistical interpretation of the intermittency region evolution equations allows to account for the non-equilibrium effects in the domain separating two phases. The source of non-equilibrium are spatial variations in the ratio of work done by volume and interfacial forces governing its width. As the statistical description of the two-phase flow differs from the deterministic two-phase flow models known in the literature, in the present work we focus discussion of the results on these differences. To this goal, the rising two dimensional gas bubble is studied; differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions are investigated. It is argued the statistical description of the intermittency region has potential to account for physical phenomena not considered previously in the computer simulations of two-phase flow.",

Then, we introduce the new notion of parallel compatibility, and show that these two notions are inequivalent. Then, we argue that the notion of traditional compatibility is incomplete, and prove that while parallel compatibility captures measurement and channel compatibility, traditional compatibility does not. Hence, we propose parallel compatibility as the conceptually complete definition of compatibility of quantum instruments.",

However, since non-proportional hazards are often encountered in oncology trials, alternative tests have been proposed. The maximum weighted logrank test was shown to be robust in general situations. In this manuscript, we propose a new maximum test that incorporates the weight for detecting crossing hazards. The new weight is a function of the crossing time-point. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare our methods with other methods proposed in the literature under scenarios with various hazard ratio patterns, sample sizes, censoring rates, and censoring patterns. For crossing hazards, the proposed test is shown to be the most powerful one with a known crossing time-point. It has a similar performance as the Maxcombo test in the misspecified crossing time-point scenario. Under other alternative situations, the new test remains comparatively powerful as the Maxcombo test. Finally, we illustrate the test in a real data example and discuss the procedures to extend the test to detect crossing hazards specifically.",

These light curves are sampled using different observing strategies, including the two proposed by the LSST, in order to compare the accuracy of time-lag retrieval based on different observing cadences.

The other one is based on a simplified form of the spin tensor and is commonly used in the current literature under the name of a phenomenological approach. We show that these two frameworks are equivalent, i.e., they can be directly connected by a suitably defined pseudogauge transformation, only if the first framework is initially improved by a suitable modification of the energy-momentum tensor (addition of a divergence-free term that cannot be interpreted as a pseudogauge). Our analysis uses arguments related to the positivity of entropy production. The latter turns out to be equivalent for the improved canonical and phenomenological frameworks.",

To this end, quantum control has become an essential tool, as it can make the entangling interaction resilient to sources of noise. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to identify an appropriate quantum control technique for a particular need given the breadth of work pertaining to robust entanglement. To this end, we attempt to consolidate the literature by providing a non-exhaustive summary and critical analysis. The quantum control methods are separated into two categories: schemes which extend the robustness to (i) spin or (ii) motional decoherence. We choose to focus on extensions of the $\\sigma_x\\otimes\\sigma_x$ Molmer-Sorensen interaction using microwaves and a static magnetic field gradient. Nevertheless, some of the techniques discussed here can be relevant to other trapped ion architectures or physical qubit implementations.

Most manuscripts on statistical methodology rely on simulation studies and provide a single real-world data set as an example to motivate and illustrate the methodology investigated.

The point of view via this transport equation has two important consequences. First, this equation reveals a new monotonicity condition that is sufficient both for the uniqueness of MFG Nash equilibria and for the global in time well-posedness of master equations. Interestingly, this condition is in general in dichotomy with both the Lasry--Lions and displacement monotonicity conditions, studied so far in the literature. Second, in the absence of monotonicity, the conservative form of the transport equation can be used to define weak entropy solutions to the master equation. We construct several concrete examples to demonstrate that MFG Nash equilibria, whether or not they actually exist, may not be selected by the entropy solutions of the master equation.",

In the first step, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice model to equilibrate the large-scale chain structure above the tube scale while ensuring a spatially homogeneous density distribution. We then use theoretical insight from a constrained mode tube model to introduce the bead degrees of freedom together with random walk conformational statistics all the way down to the Kuhn scale of the chains. This is followed by a sequence of simulations with carefully parameterized force-capped bead-spring models, which slowly introduce the local bead packing while reproducing the larger scale chain statistics of the target Kremer-Grest system at all levels of force-capping. Finally we can switch to the full Kremer-Grest model without perturbing the structure. The resulting chain statistics is in excellent agreement with literature results on all length scales accessible in brute-force simulations of shorter chains.",

The dynamics of Yukawa systems are described in the framework of the generalized hydrodynamic model that incorporates strong coupling and visco-elastic memory effects. A hydrodynamic matrix for such a system is exactly derived and then used to obtain an analytic expression for the density autocorrelation function (DAF)- a marker of the time dynamics of density fluctuations. The present approach is validated against a DAF obtained from numerical data of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a dusty plasma system that is a practical example of a Yukawa system. The MD results and analytic expressions derived from the model equations are then used to obtain various transport coefficients and the latter are compared with values available in the literature from other models. The influence of strong coupling and visco-elastic effects on the transport parameters are discussed. Finally, the utility of our calculations for obtaining reliable estimates of transport coefficients from experimentally determined DAF is pointed out.",

Motivated by the recent stream of results on the Gaussian universality of the test and training errors in generalized linear estimation, we ask ourselves the question: \"when is a single Gaussian enough to characterize the error?\". Our formula allow us to give sharp answers to this question, both in the positive and negative directions. More precisely, we show that the sufficient conditions for Gaussian universality (or lack of thereof) crucially depend on the alignment between the target weights and the means and covariances of the mixture clusters, which we precisely quantify. In the particular case of least-squares interpolation, we prove a strong universality property of the training error, and show it follows a simple, closed-form expression. Finally, we apply our results to real datasets, clarifying some recent discussion in the literature about Gaussian universality of the errors in this context.",

Interestingly, these findings indicate the need to revisit the existing schemes which rely on simplified rate equations and exponential decays to estimate the recombination parameters from pump-probe spectroscopy.

This occurs when some agents make decisions based on small samples (anecdotal evidence) while others rely on large samples.

In statistics and machine learning, significant efforts have been put into developing machinery to estimate correlations across variables efficiently. In causal inference, a large body of literature is concerned with the decomposition of causal effects under the rubric of mediation analysis. However, many variations are spurious in nature, including different phenomena throughout the applied sciences. Despite the statistical power to estimate correlations and the identification power to decompose causal effects, there is still little understanding of the properties of spurious associations and how they can be decomposed in terms of the underlying causal mechanisms. In this manuscript, we develop formal tools for decomposing spurious variations in both Markovian and Semi-Markovian models. We prove the first results that allow a non-parametric decomposition of spurious effects and provide sufficient conditions for the identification of such decompositions. The described approach has several applications, ranging from explainable and fair AI to questions in epidemiology and medicine, and we empirically demonstrate its use on a real-world dataset.",

We also propose a new concept via which the predator population blows up in finite time while the prey population quenches in finite time. The blow-up and quenching times are proved to be one and the same. Our analysis is complemented by numerical findings. This includes a numerical description of the basin of attraction for large data blow-up solutions, as well as several rich bifurcations leading to multiple limit cycles, both in co-dimension one and two.

Furthermore, I propose and consider the theoretical and empirical properties of a precise probabilistic approximation to the model-free imprecise framework. Approximating a belief/plausibility measure pair by an [optimal in some sense] probability measure in the credal set is a critical resolution needed for the broader adoption of imprecise probabilistic approaches to inference in statistical and machine learning communities. It is largely undetermined in the statistical and machine learning literatures, more generally, how to properly quantify uncertainty in that there is no generally accepted standard of accountability of stated uncertainties.

Comparing with similar conditions developed in the past literatures, we discuss all the situation when the time delay is positive, including when it is irrational. We prove that the exponential stability can be achieved if and only if the time delay is an even number. We also get the general formula term of the stability region of the coupling gain for different even multiples of time delay, and from this we easily obtain the shrink of the stability region as time delay increases. In addition, we explore the impact of slight perturbations in time delay on high frequency robustness.",

For both methods, we guarantee that the quantization error is bounded and consequently, the remote state reconstruction error is also bounded. To the best of our knowledge, the set-based method using zonotopes has no precedent in the literature and admits a larger class of linear systems and communication channels, where the set-based method allows for a longer inter-transmission time and lower bit rate.

NCM compositions with high nickel content (x > 0.8) exhibit the largest specific capacity while undergoing fast degradation and presenting safety issues. As the main degradation mechanisms of NCM materials and the mitigation of their degradation, are still subjects of many ongoing studies, this work summarizes the current knowledge on the subject. Here, the existing literature is reviewed to present the structural and electrochemical degradation of NCM with varying Ni stoichiometries (NCM111, NCM622, NCM811, and beyond). Routes for hindering the degradation of NCM are discussed as a function of Ni content in NCM and include doping, application of protective coatings, and engineering of the microstructure. A comprehensive understanding of the main degradation pathways of NCM is key to applying the most appropriate mitigation strategies and keep advancing towards higher energy NCM materials with longer cycle-life.",

We will use the idea of generalized frame operator and Gram matrix and extend it. We will use that to show properties for canonical duals for lower frame sequences, like e.g. a minimality condition regarding its coefficients. We will also show that other results that are known for frames can be generalized to lower frame sequences.

Light localization is described by introducing a new metric able to track the wavepacket center of mass. By statistical averaging this quantity over many realizations of the disorder, we demonstrate that in linear regime the ensemble averaged barycenter matches the localization length lloc as defined in literature. Then, by applying our barycenter method, we prove that for Gap-Solitons the transition from localized to ballistic transport goes faster than the vg2 law ruling the linear regime. By overcoming this scaling law, improved robustness to disorder of nonlinear waves is demonstrated.",

Specifically, it is shown that the output of a recurrent neural network, in the context of classification problems, coincides with the evolution of the population state in a population game. This connection is established with dynamic payoffs and under replicator evolutionary dynamics. The connection provides insights into the neural network's behavior from both dynamical systems and game-theoretical perspectives, aligning with recent literature that suggests that neural network outputs may resemble the Nash equilibria of suitable games. It also uncovers potential connections between the neural network classification problem and mechanism design. To illustrate our results, we present different numerical experiments in the context of classification problems.",

In some studies in the literature, authors have discussed the effects of deformed algebras such as generalized and extended uncertainty principles on the thermal quantities of these black holes. In this manuscript, we considered another deformation, the rainbow gravity formalism, and we investigated its impact on the Van der Waal black hole thermodynamics. To this end, we first generated the modified lapse and mass functions, and then we derived the modified thermal quantities such as thermodynamic volume, Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat functions. Finally, we explored the thermodynamics of a black hole, which mimics the thermodynamics of an ideal gas, under the influence of the rainbow gravity formalism.",

Two new Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions are developed in this method through the utilization of the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality and the well-known Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) approach. One of the key components of the proposed LMIs is the generalized matrix multipliers. The judicious use of these multipliers enables us to introduce more numbers of decision variables inside LMIs than the one illustrated in the literature. It aids in adding some extra degrees of freedom from a feasibility point of view, thus enhancing the LMI conditions. Thus, the established LMIs are less conservative than existing ones. Later on, the effectiveness of the developed LMIs and observer is highlighted through a numerical example and the application of state of charge (SoC) estimation in the Li-ion battery model.",

With extensive literature establishing the fact that the ammonium cations exhibit rotational motion even towards the lowest temperatures, we take into account that the orbital motion of the protons carries a magnetic moment and find it to be larger than that of the paired electrons. Consequently, the structural phase transitions are magnetically-driven as the system attempts to lift 8-fold energy degeneracies of the proton orbitals via Jahn-Teller distortions.

The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.",

Analysis of linked files commonly ignores such linkage errors, resulting in biased, or overly precise estimates of the associations of interest. We view record linkage as a missing data problem, and delineate the linkage mechanisms that underpin analysis methods with linked files. Following the missing data literature, we group these methods under three categories: likelihood and Bayesian methods, imputation methods, and weighting methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations of the methods, and evaluate their performance in a wide range of simulation scenarios.",

The prime purpose of the present manuscript is to address the stability of unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to surcharge load and pseudo-static seismic forces under different climatic conditions. The upper bound limit analysis technique was used based on the log-spiral failure mechanism. The suction stress-based effective stress approach was used to capture the effect of the unsaturated zone of the slope. The suction stress is modelled using Gardner's one-parameter hydraulic conductivity function and van-Genuchten's soil water characteristics curve. An extensive parametric study is carried out to assess the combined effect of slope geometry, soil-strength parameters, hydro-mechanical parameters, depth of water table, various flow conditions, surcharge load, and seismic loading. A few stability charts are proposed to show the impact of surcharge load and seismic load separately on unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to various climatic conditions.

Our findings indicate that a decrease in downstream tariffs lead to an increase in vertical integration. In our mechanism tests, we discover that a reduction in upstream tariffs also enhances this effect. Moreover, the impact of tariff reductions on vertical integration is primarily observed in industries with high asset specificity, indicating that asset-specificity is a crucial mechanism. We further explore whether import competition encourages vertical integration for technological acquisition purpose, the effect is found only among high-tech firms, while it's absent in non-high-tech firms.

Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.",

In the more recent literature, however, naturalism has instead been taken to entail that the traditional conception of metaphysics can be accepted if and only if one is a scientific realist (and puts the right constraints on acceptable metaphysical claims). Here, we want to suggest that naturalists can, and perhaps should, pick a third option, based on a significant yet acceptable revision of the established understanding of metaphysics. More particularly, we will claim that a fictionalist approach to metaphysics is compatible with both the idea that the discipline inquires into the fundamental features of reality and naturalistic methodology; at the same time, it meshes well with both scientific realism and instrumentalism",

Nevertheless, little work can be found in literature regarding their structural behaviour. In order to predict how a wire bearing reacts under load, the most feasible way is to model and analyse it via Finite Elements (FE). However, the great amount of elements needed to properly model the complex contact configuration among rollers, wires and raceways, make this approach unaffordable. In this sense, this manuscript develops an analytical submodel that represents the structural behaviour of the roller-wire-ring set, in order to include it later in a global FE model to account for ring flexibility and boundary conditions. This way, the computationally intensive FE modelling of these complex zones can be substituted by the analytical model developed in this work, and a much manageable global FE model can be used to predict the structural response of the bearing. This analytical model has demonstrated a good agreement with local FE models of the roller-wire-ring set.",

While NPE and NLE methods are just as accurate as ABC and BSL, we prove that this accuracy can often be achieved at a vastly reduced computational cost, and will therefore deliver more attractive approximations than ABC and BSL in certain problems.

Nowadays, Le\\'sniewski's theory is presented in the form of an elementary theory or translated into the language of the theory of relational structures. In this article, firstly, we look at existentially neutral theories, in which we do not postulate the existence of any other collective sets than those obtained from the definition and the basic properties of the relation of being a part. We also examine some existentially involved theories of parts. Among them, there is Grzegorczykian mereology and Le\\'sniewskian mereology. One of the main principles of mereology is the transitivity of the concept of being a part of. This property is often questioned in the literature on the subject. In the final part, we present problems related to the transitivity of this concept.",

In complicated systems accessible only via data or black-box models, however, these representations are rarely known. We discuss how to characterize and manipulate such representations using triangular transport maps, which approximate any complex probability distribution as a transformation of a simple, well-understood distribution. The particular structure of triangular transport guarantees many desirable mathematical and computational properties that translate well into solving practical problems. Triangular maps are actively used for density estimation, (conditional) generative modelling, Bayesian inference, data assimilation, optimal experimental design, and related tasks. While there is ample literature on the development and theory of triangular transport methods, this manuscript provides a detailed introduction for scientists interested in employing measure transport without assuming a formal mathematical background. We build intuition for the key foundations of triangular transport, discuss many aspects of its practical implementation, and outline the frontiers of this field.",

Thus derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-) vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion).

As a demonstration, we produce an infinite family of hyperbolic links where many of the manifolds arising from Dehn filling have non-left-orderable fundamental groups. The family includes the Whitehead link, and in that case we produce a collection of non-left-orderable Dehn fillings that precisely matches the prediction of the L-space conjecture.",

To ensure that the intermediary's financial equilibrium is preserved, we introduce a funding constraint in the model by enforcing in a time-consistent manner a sequential second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) of the portfolio return distribution over the liability distribution. We demonstrate that imposing the SSD constraint at the last-but-one stage is sufficient to enforce the SSD ordering at each stage. To deal with the computational burden of associated MSP, we develop a novel decomposition scheme integrating, for the first time in the literature, time-consistent dynamic risk measures and sequential stochastic dominance constraints.

The formulation is based on 2-index aggregated flow variables and incorporates a set of aggregated demand constraints, which are novel in hub location. With minor adaptations, the approach applies to a large class of single- and multiple-allocation models, possibly incorporating flow bounds on activated arcs. General-purpose feasibility and optimality inequalities are also developed. Because of the small number of continuous variables, there is no need to project them out, differentiating the method from solution algorithms that rely heavily on feasibility and optimality cuts. The proposed Branch & Solve solution framework leverages the nested structure of the problems, by solving auxiliary subproblems at selected nodes of the enumeration tree. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances from the literature confirm the good performance of the proposal: the basic version of the algorithm is able to solve to proven optimality instances with up to 200 nodes for several hub location families.",

We have first to identify the appropriate type of model for the system under consideration and then to tailor it to the specifics of the case. To understand settlement formation, which is the concern of this paper, this not only involves choosing input parameter values such as site separations but also input functions which characterises the ease of travel between sites. Although the generic behaviour of the model is understood, the details are not. Different choices will necessarily lead to different outputs (for identical inputs). We can only proceed if choices that are \"close\" give outcomes are similar. Where there are local differences it suggests that there was no compelling reason for one outcome rather than the other. If these differences are important for the historic record we may interpret this as sensitivity to contingency. We re-examine the rise of Greek city states as first formulated by Rihll and Wilson in 1979, initially using the same \"retail\" gravity model. We suggest that, whereas cities like Athens owe their position to a combination of geography and proximity to other sites, the rise of Thebes is the most contingent, whose success reflects social forces outside the grasp of simple network modelling.",

While our model achieves moderate results, we see that proprietary cloud services fare significantly better. As our results show, recognition rates over 90 percent can currently be achieved, however, these numbers drop quickly once the recordings feature limited audio quality or use of non-every day or outworn language. A big issue is the high variety of different dialects and accents in the German language. Nevertheless, this paper highlights that the currently available quality of recognition is high enough to address various use cases in the Digital Humanities.

Anticipating such extreme solar events, auroral records were also surveyed in historical documents and those including the red celestial sign after sunset in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) were subjected to consideration. Usoskin et al. (2013: U13) interpreted this record as an aurora and suggested enhanced solar activity around 774/775. Conversely, Neuhauser and Neuhauser (2015a, 2015b: N15a and N15b) interpreted \"after sunset\" as during sunset or twilight; they considered this sign as a halo display and suggested a solar minimum around 774. However, so far these records have not been discussed in comparison with eyewitness auroral records during the known extreme space-weather events, although they were discussed in relationship with potential extreme events in 774/775. Therefore, we reconstruct the observational details based on the original records in the ASC and philological references, compare them with eyewitness auroral observations during known extreme space-weather events, and consider contemporary solar activity. We clarify the observation was indeed \"after sunset\", reject the solar halo hypothesis, define the observational time span between 25 Mar. 775 and 25 Dec. 777, and note the parallel halo drawing in 806 in the ASC shown in N15b was not based on the original observation in England. We show examples of eyewitness auroral observations during twilight in known space-weather events, and this celestial sign does not contradict the observational evidence. Accordingly, we consider this event happened after the onset of the event in 774/775, but shows relatively enhanced solar activity, with other historical auroral records in the mid-770s, as also confirmed by the Be data from ice cores.",

Over the last 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded cluster properties. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within roughly 2 Kpc of the Sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 solar masses. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the IMF which, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to subsellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.",

    "abstract": "Magnets with frustration often show accidental degeneracies, characterized by a large classical ground-state space (CGSS). Quantum fluctuations may `select' one of these ground states -- a phenomenon labeled `order by (quantum) disorder' in literature. In this article, we examine the mechanism(s) by which such state selection takes place. We argue that a magnet, at low energies, maps to a particle moving on the CGSS. State selection corresponds to localization of the particle at a certain point on this space. We distinguish two mechanisms that can bring about localization. In the first, quantum fluctuations generate a potential on the CGSS. If the potential has a deep enough minimum, then the particle localizes in its vicinity. We denote this as `order by potential' (ObP). In the second scenario, the particle localizes at a self-intersection point due to bound-state formation -- a consequence of geometry and quantum interference. Following recent studies by the present authors, we denote this scenario as `order by singularity' (ObS). We place our discussion within the context of the one-dimensional spin-$S$ Kitaev model. We map out its CGSS which grows systematically with increasing system size. It resembles a network where the number of nodes increases exponentially. In addition, the number of wires that cross at each node also grows exponentially. This self-intersecting structure leads to ObS, with the low-energy physics determined by a small subset of the CGSS, consisting of `Cartesian' states. A contrasting picture emerges when an additional XY antiferromagnetic coupling is introduced. The CGSS simplifies dramatically, taking the form of a circle. Spin-wave fluctuations generate a potential on this space, giving rise to state selection by ObP under certain conditions. Apart from contrasting ObS and ObP, we discuss the possibility of ObS in macroscopic magnets.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative assessment of the growth of biological organisms has produced many mathematical equations. Many efforts have been given on statistical identification of the correct growth model from experimental data. Every growth equation is unique in terms of mathematical structures; however, one model may serve as a close approximation of the other by appropriate choice of the parameter(s). It is still a challenging problem to select the best estimating model from a set of model equations whose shapes are similar in nature. Our aim in this manuscript is to develop methodology that will reduce the efforts in model selection. This is achieved by utilizing an existing model selection criterion in an innovative way that reduces the number of model fitting exercises substantially. In this manuscript, we have shown that one model can be obtained from the other by choosing a suitable continuous transformation of the parameters. This idea builds an interconnection between many equations which are scattered in the literature. We also get several new growth equations; out of them large number of equations can be obtained from a few key models. Given a set of training data points and the key models, we utilize the idea of interval specific rate parameter (ISRP) proposed by Bhowmick et al (2014) to obtain a suitable mathematical model for the data. The ISRP profile of the parameters of simpler models indicates the nature of variation in parameters with time, thus, enable the experimenter to extrapolate the inference to more complex models. Our proposed methodology significantly reduces the efforts involved in model fitting exercises. The proposed idea is verified by using simulated and real data sets. In addition, theoretical justifications have been provided by investigating the statistical properties of the estimators.",

    "abstract": "Low-rank matrix estimation under heavy-tailed noise is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially since robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel Riemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general framework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss, and quantile loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves as in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal estimator which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly, during phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices. Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth. Lastly, RsGrad is applicable for low-rank tensor estimation under heavy-tailed noise where a statistically optimal rate is attainable with the same phenomenon of dual-phase convergence, and a novel shrinkage-based second-order moment method is guaranteed to deliver a warm initialization. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of RsGrad over prior methods.",

    "abstract": "Shared spaces aim to reduce the dominance of motor vehicles by promoting pedestrian and cyclist activity and minimizing segregation between road users. Despite the intended scope to improve the safety of vulnerable road users, only few works in the literature focused on before after safety evaluations, mainly analyzing changes in users trajectories and speeds, traffic volumes, and conflict counts, which, while useful, cannot univocally quantify road safety. Here, we propose a more advanced methodology, based on surrogate measures of safety and Extreme Value Theory, to assess road safety before and after the implementation of a shared space. The aim is to produce a crash risk estimation in different scenarios, obtaining a quantitative and comprehensive indicator, useful to practitioners for evaluating the safety of urban design solutions. A real world case study illustrates the proposed procedure. Video data were collected on two separate days, before and after a shared space implementation, and were semiautomatically processed to extract road users trajectories. Analysis of traffic volumes, trajectories, speeds and yield ratios allowed to understand the spatial behavior of road users in the two scenarios. Traffic conflicts, identified with an innovative surrogate measure of safety called time to avoided collision point, TTAC, were then used to estimate a Lomax distribution, and therefore to model the probabilistic relationship between conflicts and crashes, eventually retrieving a crash risk estimate. Results show that the analyzed shared space was able to significantly reduce the risk of crashes, and these findings are consistent with the observed changes in users speed and spatial behavior. The analyzed case study and its limitations were useful in highlighting the methodology main features and suggesting practical prescriptions for practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to improve the information processing power to levels unreachable by classical computation. Quantum walks are heading the development of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more efficiently than their classical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures whose vertices have a self-loop of weight $l$. This paper addresses several issues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. Furthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal adjustment of the self-loop weight $l$ for such $d$-dimensional grids. It turns out other fits of $l$ found in the literature are particular cases. Finally, we observe a two-to-one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum walk and Grover's algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping condition. In conclusion, this work deals with practical issues one should consider when applying the lackadaisical quantum walk, besides expanding the technique to a broader range of search problems.",

    "abstract": "The miniaturization of inertial measurement units (IMUs) facilitates their widespread use in a growing number of application domains. Orientation estimation is a prerequisite for most further data processing steps in inertial motion tracking, such as position/velocity estimation, joint angle estimation, and 3D visualization. Errors in the estimated orientations severely affect all further processing steps. Recent systematic comparisons of existing algorithms show that out-of-the-box accuracy is often low and that application-specific tuning is required to obtain high accuracy. In the present work, we propose and extensively evaluate a quaternion-based orientation estimation algorithm that is based on a novel approach of filtering the acceleration measurements in an almost-inertial frame and that includes extensions for gyroscope bias estimation and magnetic disturbance rejection, as well as a variant for offline data processing. In contrast to all existing work, we perform an extensive evaluation, using a large collection of publicly available datasets and eight literature methods for comparison. The proposed method consistently outperforms all literature methods and achieves an average RMSE of 2.9{\\deg}, while the errors obtained with literature methods range from 5.3{\\deg} to 16.7{\\deg}. Since the evaluation was performed with one single fixed parametrization across a very diverse dataset collection, we conclude that the proposed method provides unprecedented out-of-the-box performance for a broad range of motions, sensor hardware, and environmental conditions. This gain in orientation estimation accuracy is expected to advance the field of IMU-based motion analysis and provide performance benefits in numerous applications. The provided open-source implementation makes it easy to employ the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Einstein's research manuscripts provide important insights into his exceptional creativity. At the same time, they can present difficulties for a publication in the documentary edition of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein (CPAE). The problems are illustrated by discussing how some important examples of Einstein's research manuscripts have been included in previous volumes of the CPAE series: his Scratch Notebook from the years 1910-1914, his so-called Zurich Notebook from 1912, documenting his early search for a generally covariant theory of gravitation, and the Einstein-Besso manuscript from 1913, containing calculations of Mercury's perihelion advance on the basis of the Einstein-Grossmann equations. Another category of research notes are \"back-of-an-envelope\" calculations. A major challenge for future volumes of the CPAE series are Einstein's Berlin and Princeton research manuscripts on a unified field theory. This batch of some 1700 undated manuscript pages presents a formidable challenge also for historians of science. Although the web provides new possibilities for the editorial task, such as the publication of facsimiles on the Einstein Archives Online website, it is argued that a satisfactory solution of the editorial problems posed by these manuscripts depends on scholarly efforts to reconstruct and understand the content of Einstein's manuscripts.",

AX J0843+2942, positionally coincident with the core of a triple and strong (S_1.4 GHz ~ 1 Jy; P_1.4 GHz ~ 9 x 10E33 erg s-1 Hz-1) radio source, is spectroscopically identified with a Narrow Line object (intrinsic FWHM of all the permitted emission lines <= 1200 km s-1) at z=0.398, having line features and ratios typical of Seyfert-2 like objects. The high X-ray luminosity, coupled with the high intrinsic absorption, the optical spectral properties and the radio power, allow us to propose AX J0843+2942 as a Radio-Loud \"Type 2 QSO\".

Although, from a phenomenological point of view, the observed properties can be described by a simple power law model plus 5 narrow Gaussian lines (at rest frame energies of nearly 4.49, 5.55, 6.39, 7.02 and 7.85 keV), we find that a model comprising a power law (Gamma of the order of 2.2), a reflected relativistic continuum, a narrow Fe I Kalpha line from neutral material as well as a broad Fe Kalpha relativistic line from a ionized accretion disk represents a good physical description of the data. The ''double horned'' profile of the relativistic line implies an inclination of the accretion disk of the order of 45 degree, and an origin in a narrow region of the disk, from R_in of the order of 19 GM/c^2 to R_out of the order of 30 GM/c^2. The narrow Fe I Kalpha line from neutral material is probably produced far from the central black hole, most likely in the putative molecular torus. Although some of these properties have been already found in other Type 1 AGN and discussed in the literature, at odd with the objects reported so far we measure high equivalent widths (EWs) of the observed lines: nearly 1.4 keV for the ``double horned'' relativistic line and nearly 0.4 keV for the narrow line.",

We confine our attention here to the BEC and near-BEC regime where analytical calculations are possible. At finite $T$, non-condensed fermion pairs must be included, although they have been generally ignored in the literature. Within this BEC regime we compute the equations of state for the one and two channel models; these two cases correspond to whether Feshbach resonance effects are omitted or included. Differences between these two cases can be traced to differences between the nature of a Cooper pair and bosonic condensate. Our results are also compared with the Gross Pitaevskii equations of state for true bosons. Differences found here are associated with the underlying fermionic character of the system. Finally, the particle density distribution functions for a trap containing superfluid fermionic atoms are computed using a Thomas-Fermi approach. The one and two channel behavior is found to be very different; we find a narrowing of the density profile as a result of Feshbach resonance effects. Importantly, we infer that the ratio between bosonic and fermionic scattering lengths depends on the magnetic detuning and is generally smaller than 2. Future experiments will be required to determine to what extent this ratio varies with magnetic fields.",

Because diverse connectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also because they provide the means to identify and classify several types of complex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the local network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced in the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks connectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of nodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two. These chains have been subdivided into cords, tails, rings and handles, depending on the type of their extremities (e.g. open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the density of such motifs in random and scale free networks is described, and an algorithm for identifying those motifs in general networks is presented. The potential of considering chains for network characterization has been illustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16 cases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that several chains were observed in the real-world networks, especially the WWW, books, and power-grid. The possibility of chains resulting from incompletely sampled networks is also investigated.",

In literature, various techniques have been presented, but no general consensus about their real performances and properties has been reached. This is due to the characteristics of these techniques that have been studied essentially through numerical simulations based on semi-empirical models of the CMB and the Galactic foregrounds. Such models often have different level of sophistication and/or are based on different physical assumptions (e.g., the number of the Galactic components and the level of the noise). Hence, a reliable comparison is difficult. What actually is missing is a statistical analysis of the properties of the proposed methodologies. Here, we consider the \"Internal Linear Combination\" method (ILC) which, among the separation techniques, requires the smallest number of \"a priori\" assumptions. This feature is of particular interest in the context of the CMB polarization measurements at small angular scales where the lack of knowledge of the polarized backgrounds represents a serious limit. METHODS: The statistical characteristics of ILC are examined through an analytical approach and the basic conditions are fixed in a way to work satisfactorily. RESULTS: ILC provides satisfactory results only under rather restrictive conditions. This is a critical fact to take into consideration in planning the future ground-based observations (e.g., with ALMA) where, contrary to the satellite experiments, there is the possibility to have a certain control of the experimental conditions.",

Here, `metric' means the square of the norm defined on the tangent space, and not necessarily induced from an inner product (this property hereafter will be called inner-product-assumption), different from usual metric used in differential geometry. As for metrics in So far, there have been plenty of literatures on the metric in the space of probability distributions and quantum states. Among them, Cencov proved the monotone metric in probability distribution space is unique up to constant multiple, and identical to Fisher information metric. Petz characterized all the monotone metrics in the quantum state space using operator mean. As for channels, however, only a little had been known. In this paper, we impose monotonicity by concatenation of channels before and after the given channel families, and invariance by tensoring identity channels. (Notably, we do not use the inner-product-assumption.) To obtain this result, `resource conversion' technique, which is widely used in quantum information, is used. We consider distillation from and formation to a family of channels. Under these axioms, we identify the largest and the smallest `metrics'. Interestingly, they are not induced from any inner product, i.e., not a metric. Indeed, one can prove that any `metric' satisfying our axioms can not be a metric. This result has some impact on the axiomatic study of the monotone metric in the space of classical and quantum states, since both conventional theory relies on the inner-product-assumption. Also, we compute the lower and the upper bound for some concrete examples.",

Most of the unmixing algorithms proposed in the literature do not take into account the possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian model is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is assumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical properties of the abundance coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field is then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any class. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the classical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy is investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow ones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the abundances for each pixel, the means and variances of the abundances for each class, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in the image. To overcome the complexity of the posterior distribution of interest, we consider Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that generate samples distributed according to the posterior of interest. The generated samples are then used for parameter and hyperparameter estimation. The accuracy of the proposed algorithms is illustrated on synthetic and real data.",

In the case of treatments, we study the difference in performance that arises when they are applied in systematic and non-systematic ways. Using some reasonable simplifying assumptions (as random mixing of human groups and the same mobility for all life stages of head lice other than eggs) we model the contagion of pediculosis using only one additional parameter. It is shown that this parameter can be tuned to obtain collective infestations whose variables are compatible with what is given in the literature on real infestations. We analyze two scenarios: one where group members begin treatment when a similar number of lice are present in each head, and another where there is one individual who starts treatment with a much larger threshold ('superspreader'). For both cases we assess the impact of several collective strategies of treatment.",

We firstly check properties of mapped AGN collected from literature in plane of $\\sHb^2/\\sHa^2$ vs $\\RHa/\\RHb$. Commonly, virial BH masses based on observed broad H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ should be coincident. However, among the mapped objects, PG0052 and NGC4253 are two apparent outliers in the plane of $\\sHb^2/\\sHa^2$ vs $\\RHa/\\RHb$, which indicate BLRs of PG0052 and NGC4253 have some special characters. Then based on the 55 public spectra of PG0052, BLR of PG0052 is been carefully studied in detail. We find that line width ratio of total observed broad H$\\alpha$ to total observed broad H$\\beta$ is $\\sim$0.7, which is much smaller than theoretical/observational value of $\\sim$0.9. Furthermore, flux ratio of total broad H$\\alpha$ to total broad H$\\beta$ is about 6.8 (Balmer Decrement), which is not one reasonable value for BLUE quasar PG 0052+251. Moreover, properties of line cores based on PCA technique confirm there is one inner broad component and one seriously obscured intermediate broad component in BLR of PG0052. If the seriously obscured intermediate BLR was accepted, properties of PG0052 in the plane of $\\sHb^2/\\sHa^2$ vs $\\RHa/\\RHb$ could be well reproduced, which indicates that the intermediate BLR actually is well appropriate to mapped quasar PG 0052+251. Finally, the large distance between inner component of BLR and intermediate component of BLR based on CCF results rejects the possibility that the intermediate component is probably extended part of inner component of BLR.",

    "abstract": "The permeability of a porous medium is strongly affected by its local geometry and connectivity, the size distribution of the solid inclusions and the pores available for flow. Since direct measurements of the permeability are time consuming and require experiments that are not always possible, the reliable theoretical assessment of the permeability based on the medium structural characteristics alone is of importance. When the porosity approaches unity, the permeability-porosity relationships represented by the Kozeny-Carman equations and Archie's law predict that permeability tends to infinity and thus they yield unrealistic results if specific area of the porous media does not tend to zero. The goal of this paper is an evaluation of the relationships between porosity and permeability for a set of fractal models with porosity approaching unity and a finite permeability. It is shown that the tube bundles generated by finite iterations of the corresponding geometric fractals can be used to model porous media where the permeability-porosity relationships are derived analytically. Several examples of the tube bundles are constructed and relevance of the derived permeability-porosity relationships is discussed in connection with the permeability measurements of highly porous metal foams reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The reduced density matrix of excitons coupled to a phonon bath at a finite temperature is studied using the path integral Monte Carlo method. Appropriate choices of estimators and importance sampling schemes are crucial to the performance of the Monte Carlo simulation. We show that by choosing the population-normalized estimator for the reduced density matrix, an efficient and physically-meaningful sampling function can be obtained. In addition, the nonadiabatic phonon probability density is obtained as a byproduct during the sampling procedure. For importance sampling, we adopted the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. The analytic expression for the gradient of the target probability density function associated with the population-normalized estimator cannot be obtained in closed form without a matrix power series. An approximated gradient that can be efficiently calculated is explored to achieve better computational scaling and efficiency. Application to a simple one-dimensional model system from the previous literature confirms the correctness of the method developed in this manuscript. The displaced harmonic model system within the single exciton manifold shows the numerically exact temperature dependence of the coherence and population of the excitonic system. The sampling scheme can be applied to an arbitrary anharmonic environment, such as multichromophoric systems embedded in the protein complex. The result of this study is expected to stimulate further development of real time propagation methods that satisfy the detailed balance condition for exciton populations.",

We have also previously proposed that thermodynamic theory, which allowed for the first time derivation of an absolute measurement scale for temperature (T), could be used to derive an absolute scale for evidence (E). Here we present a novel thermodynamically-based framework in which measurement of E on an absolute scale, for which \"one degree\" always means the same thing, becomes possible for the first time. The new framework invites us to think about statistical analyses in terms of the flow of (evidential) information, placing this work in the context of a growing literature on connections among physics, information theory, and statistics.",

These observation confirm the arc-shaped morphology of the emission reported earlier. The total flux as a function of time is roughly constant when the source is \"on\", but falls below the detection limit as the wind collision region approaches periastron in its orbit around the contact binary at the center of the system. In addition, at one of the \"on\" epochs, the flux drops to about a fifth of its average value. We suggest that this apparent variation could result from the inhomogeneity of the wind that hides part of the flux rather than from an intrinsic variation. We measured a trigonometrical parallax, for the most compact radio emission of 0.61 $\\pm$ 0.22 mas, corresponding to a distance of 1.65 $^{+0.96}_{-0.44}$ kpc, in agreement with recent trigonometrical parallaxes measured for objects in the Cygnus X complex. Using constraints on the total mass of the system and orbital parameters previously reported in the literature, we obtain two independent indirect measurements of the distance to the Cyg OB2 #5 system, both consistent with 1.3--1.4 kpc.

The influential work of Shabani and Lidar [PRL {\\bf 102}, 100402 (2009)] famously related this issue to quantum discord, a concept which has in recent years occupied the centre-stage of quantum information theory and has led to several fundamental results. They suggested that reduced dynamics is completely positive if and only if the initial system-bath correlations have vanishing quantum discord. Here we show that there is, within the Shabani-Lidar framework, no scope for any distinguished role for quantum discord in respect of complete positivity of reduced dynamics.

We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques.

Correlation matrices composed with various levels of fermion source/sink smearing are used to project low-lying states. The consideration of 25,600 fermion propagators reveals the presence of more than one state in what would normally be regarded as an eigenstate-projected correlation function. This observation is in accord with the scenario where the eigenstates contain a strong mixing of single and multi-particle states but only the single particle component has a strong coupling to the interpolating field. Employing a two-exponential fit to the eigenvector-projected correlation function, we are able to confirm the presence of two eigenstates. The lower-lying eigenstate is consistent with a N-pi scattering threshold and has a relatively small coupling to the three-quark interpolating field. We discuss the impact of this small scattering-state contamination in the eigenvector projected correlation function on previous results presented in the literature.",

This allows for efficient calculation of the electronic structure of clusters (and molecules) with high accuracy and systematic convergence properties without the need for any artificial periodicity. The basis functions in this method form a complete orthonormal set and are expressible in terms of spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions. Computation of the occupied eigenstates of the discretized Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is carried out using a combination of preconditioned block eigensolvers and Chebyshev polynomial filter accelerated subspace iterations. Several algorithmic and computational aspects of the method, including computation of the electrostatics terms and parallelization are discussed. We have implemented these methods and algorithms into an efficient and reliable package called ClusterES (Cluster Electronic Structure). A variety of benchmark calculations employing local and non-local pseudopotentials are carried out using our package and the results are compared to the literature. Convergence properties of the basis set are discussed through numerical examples. Computations involving large systems that contain thousands of electrons are demonstrated to highlight the efficacy of our methodology. The use of our method to study clusters with arbitrary point group symmetries is briefly discussed.",

This internal linear momentum of the system is related to the controversial concept of \"hidden momentum.\" We suggest that the term \"hidden momentum\" be abandoned. Here we use the relativistic conservation law for the center of energy to give an unambiguous definition of the \"internal momentum of a system,\" and then we exhibit this internal momentum for the system of a magnet (modeled as a circular ring of moving charges) and a distant static point charge. The calculations provide clear illustrations of this system for three cases: a) the moving charges of the magnet are assumed to continue in their unperturbed motion, b) the moving charges of the magnet are free to accelerate but have no mutual interactions, and c) the moving charges of the magnet are free to accelerate and also interact with each other. It is noted that when the current-carrying charges of the magnet are allowed to interact, the magnet itself will contain internal electromagnetic linear momentum, something which has not been presented clearly in the research and teaching literature.",

In the first part, we address the enumeration of planar maps equipped with a spanning forest, here called forested maps, with a weight $z$ per face and a weight $u$ per non-root component of the forest. Equivalently, we count (with respect to the number of faces) the planar maps $C$ weighted by $T_C(u+1,1)$, where $T_C$ is the Tutte polynomial of $C$. We begin by a purely combinatorial characterization of the corresponding generating function, denoted by $F(z,u)$. We deduce from this that $F(z,u)$ is differentially algebraic in $z$, that is, satisfies a polynomial differential equation in $z$. Finally, for $u \\geq -1$, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the $n$th coefficient of $F (z,u)$. We observe a phase transition at $0$, with a very unusual regime in $n^{-3}\\ln^{-2} (n)$ for $u \\in [-1,0[$, which testifies a new universality class for planar maps. In the second part, we propose a framework unifying the notions of activity used in the literature to describe the Tutte polynomial. The new notion of activity thereby defined is called $\\Delta$-activity. It gathers all the notions of activities that were already known and has nice properties, as Crapo's property that defines a partition of the lattice of the spanning subgraphs into intervals with respect to the activity. Lastly we conjecture that every activity that describes the Tutte polynomial and that satisfies Crapo's property can be defined in terms of $\\Delta$-activity.",

A community is considered as a tightly interconnected group of actors; therefore, it does not borrow any assumption from balance theory and merely uses the well-known assumption in the community detection literature. We found that if one detects the communities based on only positive relations (by ignoring the negative ones), the majority of negative relations are already placed between the communities. In other words, negative ties do not have a major role in detecting communities of studied signed networks. Moreover, regarding the internal negative ties, we proved that most unbalanced communities are maximally balanced, and hence they cannot be partitioned into k nonempty sub-clusters with higher balancedness (k >= 2). Furthermore, we showed that although the mediator triad ++- (hostile-mediator-hostile) is underrepresented, it constitutes a considerable portion of triadic relations among communities. Hence, mediator triads should not be ignored by community detection and clustering algorithms. As a result, if one uses a clustering algorithm that operates merely based on social balance, mesoscopic structure of signed networks significantly remains hidden.",

The question had been previously considered by V.I.Arnold [2, Ch III, \\S 1, n. 6, p. 128] in the 60s, for the particular case of the planar three--body problem, where, due to the limited number of degrees of freedom, it was enough to use the invariance of the system by the SO(3) group.   The proof exploits nice parity properties of a new set of coordinates for the planetary problem, which reduces completely the number of degrees of freedom for the system (in particular, its degeneracy due to rotations) and, moreover, is well fitted to its reflection invariance.

This theory is based on the method of separation of variables and the application of an addition theorem for cylindrical functions. The purpose of this tutorial is to assemble the practical tools necessary to implement the 2D-GLMT method for the computation of scattering by passive scatterers or of resonances in optically active media. The first part contains a derivation of the vector and scalar Helmholtz equations for 2D geometries, starting from Maxwell's equations. Optically active media are included in 2D-GLMT using a recent stationary formulation of the Maxwell-Bloch equations called steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT), which introduces new classes of solutions useful for resonance computations. Following these preliminaries, a detailed description of 2D-GLMT is presented. The emphasis is placed on the derivation of beam-shape coefficients for scattering computations, as well as the computation of resonant modes using a combination of 2D-GLMT and SALT.

In complement to our previous work, we focus here on the finite size scaling in terms of pseudo-critical temperatures. We find notably that the mean value and the fluctuations of the pseudo-$T_c$ scale with the same exponent, the correlation length exponent $\\nu_r$ (for which we provide the refined evaluation $\\nu_r=2.9 \\pm 0.4$). This result (coherent with the typical picture that describes random ferromagnets, when disorder is relevant) is at variance with numerical results reported in the literature for the PS model with self-avoidance, leading to an alternative scenario with a pseudo first order transition. We moreover introduce a crossover chain length $N^*$, which we evaluate, appropriate for characterizing the approach to the asymptotic regime in this model. Essentially, below $N^*$, the behaviour of the model in our study could also agree with such alternative scenario. Based on an approximate prediction of the dependence of $N^*$ on the parameters of the model, we show that following the choice of such parameters it could be not possible to reach the asymptotic regime in practice. In such context it becomes then possible to reconcile the apparently contradictory numerical studies.",

    "abstract": "Many calls to improve science education in college and university settings have focused on improving instructor pedagogy. Meanwhile, science education at the K-12 level is undergoing significant changes as a result of the emphasis on scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. This framework of \"three-dimensional learning\" is based on the literature about how people learn science and how we can help students put their knowledge to use. Recently, similar changes are underway in higher education by incorporating three-dimensional learning into college science courses. As these transformations move forward, it will become important to assess three-dimensional learning both to align assessments with the learning environment, and to assess the extent of the transformations. In this paper we introduce the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which is designed to characterize and support the development of assessment tasks in biology, chemistry, and physics that align with transformation efforts. We describe the development process used by our interdisciplinary team, discuss the validity and reliability of the protocol, and provide evidence that the protocol can distinguish between assessments that have the potential to elicit evidence of three-dimensional learning and those that do not.",

Under weak conditions imposed on the underlying data generating mechanism, we find the asymptotic equivalents to the optimal shrinkage intensities and estimate them consistently. The proposed nonparametric estimator for the high-dimensional mean vector has a simple structure and is proven to minimize asymptotically, with probability $1$, the quadratic loss when $c\\in(0,1)$. When $c\\in(1, \\infty)$ we modify the estimator by using a feasible estimator for the precision covariance matrix. To this end, an exhaustive simulation study and an application to real data are provided where the proposed estimator is compared with known benchmarks from the literature.

Mediating the movements of people and resources, urban street networks offer a spatial footprint of these activities; consequently their structural characteristics have been of great interest in the literature. In comparison, relatively limited attention has been devoted to the interplay between street structure and its functional usage, i.e., the movement patterns of people and resources. To address this, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the world. The routes are sampled in a geographically unbiased way such that their properties can be mapped on to each city, with their summary statistics capturing mesoscale connectivity patterns representing the complete space of possible movement in cities. The collective morphology of routes exhibits a directional bias that could be described as influenced by the attractive (or repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility and travel demand that relate to various socioeconomic factors. To capture this feature, we propose a simple metric, inness, that maps this force field. An analysis of the morphological patterns of individual cities reveals structural and socioeconomic commonalities among cities with similar inness patterns, in particular that they cluster into groups that are correlated with their size and putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of socioeconomic and infrastructural indicators. Our results lend weight to the insight that levels of urban socioeconomic development are intrinsically tied to increasing physical connectivity and diversity of road hierarchies.",

For simplicity, this Fermi surface is assumed to be constructed from arcs of a circle connected at vertices which is an idea borrowed from Banik and Overhauser. Such a diamond-shaped pocket is proposed to be the product of biaxial charge-density wave order, which was subsequently confirmed in x-ray scattering experiments. Since those x-ray scattering experiments were performed, the biaxial Fermi surface reconstruction scheme has garnered widespread support in the scientific literature. It has been shown to accurately account for the cross-section of the Fermi surface pocket observed in quantum oscillation measurements, the sign and behavior of the Hall coefficient, the size of the high magnetic field electronic contribution to the heat capacity and more recently the form of the angle-dependent magnetoresistance.In their comment, Chakravarty and Wang raise several important questions relating to the validity of the Hall coefficient we calculated for such a diamond-shaped Fermi surface pocket. These questions concern specifically (1) whether a change in sign of the Hall coefficient R_H with magnetic field and temperature is dependent on a `special' form for the rounding of the vertices, (2) whether a pocket of such a geometry can produce quantum oscillations in R_H in the absence of other Fermi surface sections and (3) whether a reconstructed Fermi surface consisting of a single pocket is less `natural' than one consisting of multiple pockets.

The in-plane stiffness and bulk modulus for $s$-triazine sheet are found to be less than that of heptazine. The reduction can be related to the nature of the covalent bonds connecting the adjacent sheets and the number of atoms per unit cell. The Poisson's ratio of $s$-triazine is half the value to that of graphene. Additionally, the calculated values of the two critical strains (elastic and yielding points) of $s$-triazine sheet are in the same order of magnitude to that for heptazine which was calculated using MD simulations in the literature. It is also demonstrated that $s$-triazine sheet can withstand larger tension in the plastic region. These results established a stable mechanical property for $s$-triazine sheet. We found a linear relationship of bandgap as a function of bi-axial tensile strain within the harmonic elastic region. The reduced steric repulse of the lone pairs ($\\mathrm{p}_x$-, $\\mathrm {p}_y$-) causes the $\\mathrm {p}_z$-like orbital to shift to high energy, and consequently an increase in the bandgap. We find no electronic properties modulation of the $s$-triazine sheet under electric field up to a peak value of 10 V/nm. Such noble properties may be useful in future nanomaterial applications.",

Half-throats define the connectivity of the network at the coarsest level, connecting each pore to half-throats of its neighboring pores from their narrower ends, while corners define the connectivity of pore crevices. The corners are discretized at different levels for accurate calculation of entry pressures, fluid volumes and flow conductivities that are obtained using direct simulation of flow on the underlying image. This paper discusses the two-phase flow model that is used to compute the averaged flow properties of the generalized network, including relative permeability and capillary pressure. We validate the model using direct finite-volume two-phase flow simulations on synthetic geometries, and then present a comparison of the model predictions with a conventional pore-network model and experimental measurements of relative permeability in the literature.",

Here we analyse the authors' methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low economic cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, which the authors have evaluated positively elsewhere, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and decreasing in cost every year.",

We consider cases of transverse (i.e. 2-D) modes and longitudinal modes, i.e. 3-D modes with sinusoidal dependence in the longitudinal direction. The triangular geometries considered have slopping beach boundaries that should in principle limit the applicability of the approximate Dirichlet-Neumann operators. We nevertheless see that the approximate operators give remarkably close results for transverse even modes, while for odd transverse modes we have some discrepancies near the boundary. In the case of longitudinal modes, where the theory only yields even modes, the different approximate operators show more discrepancies for the first two longitudinal modes and better agreement for higher modes. The ad-hoc approximation is generally closer to exact modes away from the boundary.",

In contrast, for He ions non-linear velocity scaling is observed in all investigated materials. Static calculations using density functional theory (DFT) available from literature accurately predict the SCS of Ni and Ni-Si alloy in the regime with observed velocity proportionality. At higher energies, the energy dependence of the deduced SCS of Ni for protons and He ions agrees with the prediction by recent time dependent DFT calculations. The measured SCS of the Ni-Si alloy was compared to the SCS obtained from Bragg's rule based on SCS for Ni and Si deduced in this study, yielding good agreement for protons, but systematic deviations for He projectiles, by almost 20%.

Here we investigate the effects of compressive and tensile strain (up to +/-5%) on the structure, electronic properties and the reactivity of pure, N-doped and P-doped graphene, using DFT calculations. We demonstrate the possibility of tuning the topology of the graphene surface by strain, as well as by the choice of the dopant atom. The reactivity of (doped) strained graphene is probed using H and Na as simple adsorbates of great practical importance. Strain can both enhance and weaken H and Na adsorption on (doped) graphene. In case of Na adsorption, a linear relationship is observed between the Na adsorption energy on P-doped graphene and the phosphorus charge. A linear relationship between the Na adsorption energy on flat graphene surfaces and strain is found. Based on the adsorption energies and electrical conductivity, potentially good candidates for hydrogen storage and sodium-ion battery electrodes are discussed.",

This musculoskeletal disorder is assessed from clinical symptoms, and typically confirmed via radiographic assessment. This visual assessment done by a radiologist requires experience, and suffers from moderate to high inter-observer variability. The recent literature has shown that deep learning methods can reliably perform the OA severity assessment according to the gold standard Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. However, these methods require large amounts of labeled data, which are costly to obtain. In this study, we propose the Semixup algorithm, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach to leverage unlabeled data. Semixup relies on consistency regularization using in- and out-of-manifold samples, together with interpolated consistency. On an independent test set, our method significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art SSL methods in most cases. Finally, when compared to a well-tuned fully supervised baseline that yielded a balanced accuracy (BA) of $70.9\\pm0.8%$ on the test set, Semixup had comparable performance -- BA of $71\\pm0.8%$ $(p=0.368)$ while requiring $6$ times less labeled data. These results show that our proposed SSL method allows building fully automatic OA severity assessment tools with datasets that are available outside research settings.",

The chains are generated using a discrete process of growth, in cubic networks and in a finite time, without border limits and without exploring all the configurational space. First, we thoroughly describe the chains morphology exploring the statistics of two characteristic distances, the radius of gyration and the end-to-end distance. Moreover, we examine the dependence of mean characteristic distances with the number of steps (N). Despite the simplicity of our procedure, we obtain universal critical exponents, which are in very good agreement with previous values reported in the literature. Moreover, studying the balance between the monomer-monomer interaction and the bending energy, we find that initially, the chains develop by multiple doubling, forming a cluster and increasing its energy. After reaching a given number of steps, the chains stretch and flee from the cluster, which results in a reduction of its interaction energy. However, the behaviour of the bending energy reveals that the chains follow the same folding pathway in both regimes. Additionally, we also characterize the energy of the obtained chains, combining the local interaction energy with its corresponding bending energy but in a discrete version. This analysis is relevant because it allows differentiating between chains of equal interaction energy but with different structures.",

Hitherto, the solutions proposed in the literature suffer from either long-term numerical instability due to particle-path degeneracy or, in the case that degeneracy is remedied by particle approximation of the so-called backward kernel, high computational demands. In order to balance optimally computational speed against numerical stability, we propose to furnish a (fast) naive particle smoother, propagating recursively a sample of particles and associated smoothing statistics, with an adaptive backward-sampling-based updating rule which allows the number of (costly) backward samples to be kept at a minimum. This yields a new, function-specific additive smoothing algorithm, AdaSmooth, which is computationally fast, numerically stable and easy to implement. The algorithm is provided with rigorous theoretical results guaranteeing its consistency, asymptotic normality and long-term stability as well as numerical results demonstrating empirically the clear superiority of AdaSmooth to existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We report a structural study of the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP, utilizing diffraction and imaging techniques, where we show that they contain a high density of defects, leading to non-stoichiometric single crystals of both semimetals. Despite the observed defects and non-stoichiometry on samples grown using techniques already reported in the literature, de Haas-van Alphen measurements on TaP reveal quantum oscillations and a high carrier mobility, an indication that the crystals are of quality comparable to those reported elsewhere. Electronic structure calculations on TaAs reveal that the position of the Weyl points relative to the Fermi level shift with the introduction of vacancies and stacking faults. In the case of vacancies the Fermi surface becomes considerably altered, while the effect of stacking faults on the electronic structure is to allow the Weyl pockets to remain close to the Fermi surface. The observation of quantum oscillations in a non-stoichiometric crystal and the persistence of Weyl fermion pockets near the Fermi surface in a crystal with stacking faults point to the robustness of these quantum phenomena in these materials.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the vibronic spectrum probes dynamical processes in molecular systems. When interpreted via suitable theoretical tools, the experimental data provides comprehensive information about the system in question. For complex many-body problems, such an approach usually requires the formulation of proper classical-like approximations, which is particularly challenging if multiple electronic states are involved. In this manuscript, we express the imaginary-time shifted time correlation function (TCF) and, thus, the vibronic spectrum in terms of the so-called Matsubara dynamics, which combines quantum statistics and classical-like dynamics. In contrast to the existing literature, we invoke a local harmonic approximation to the potential allowing an analytical evaluation of integrals. By subsequently applying the Matsubara approximation, we derive a generalization of the existing Matsubara method to multiple potential energy surfaces (PESs), which, however, suffers from the sign problem as its single-PES counterpart does. The mathematical analysis for two shifted harmonic oscillators suggests a new modified method to simulate the standard correlation function via classical-like dynamics. Importantly, this modified method samples the thermal Wigner function without suffering from the sign problem and it yields an accurate approximation to the vibronic absorption spectrum, not only for the harmonic system, but also for an anharmonic one.",

    "abstract": "Choosing a suitable model and determining its associated parameters from fitting to experimental data is fundamental for many problems in biomechanics. Models of shear-thinning complex fluids, dating from the work of Bird, Carreau, Cross and Yasuda, have been applied in highly-cited computational studies of heamodynamics for several decades. In this manuscript we revisit these models, first to highlight a degree of uncertainty in the naming conventions in the literature, but more importantly to address the problem of inferring model parameters by fitting rheology experiments. By refitting published data, and also by simulation, we find large, flat regions in likelihood surfaces that yield families of parameter sets which fit the data equally well. Despite having almost indistinguishable fits to experimental data these varying parameter sets can predict very different flow profiles, and as such these parameters cannot be used to draw conclusions about physical properties of the fluids, such as zero-shear viscosity or relaxation time of the fluid, or indeed flow behaviours. We verify that these features are not a consequence of the experimental data sets through simulations; by sampling points from the rheological models and adding a small amount of noise we create a synthetic data set which reveals that the problem of parameter identifiability is intrinsic to these models.",

    "abstract": "Contact friction is a key influence factor for the shearing behaviour of granular media. In the discrete element method (DEM) contact friction is usually modelled with Coulomb's law assuming a constant interparticle friction coefficient. From tribology it is known that friction is influenced by several factors, e.g., temperature, normal stress, surface condition, etc. None of these influences can be modelled with the constant interparticle friction coefficient from Coulomb's law. For a given granular material (particle shape distribution), the usage of constant interparticle friction in DEM models generally results in constant bulk friction coefficients in the simulation of direct shear tests. While this is frequently seen in experiments with equi-sized spherical particles, papers exist in literature which report a stress dependency of bulk friction for non-spherical particles of certain materials. In this work, a stress dependency of bulk friction is obtained by introducing a model for stress dependent interparticle friction in DEM simulations. For validation experimental results of direct shear tests conducted on single or paired glass beads are used. While the bulk friction of paired spheres clearly decreases with increasing normal stress, it is nearly constant for single spheres. DEM simulations with the stress dependent interparticle friction are in good accordance with the experimental results of both single and paired spheres. A comparison with simulations, using constant interparticle friction, clearly shows the advantage of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "We study the time correlation functions of coupled linear Langevin dynamics without and with inertia effects, both analytically and numerically. The model equation represents the physical behavior of a harmonic oscillator in two or three dimensions in the presence of friction, noise, and an external field with both rotational and deformational components. This simple model plays pivotal roles in understanding more complicated processes. The presented analytical solution serves as a test of numerical integration schemes, its derivation is presented in a fashion that allows to be repeated directly in a classroom. While the results in the absence of fields (equilibrium) or confinement (free particle) are omnipresent in the literature, we write down, apparently for the first time, the full nonequilibrium results that may correspond, e.g., to a Hookean dumbbell embedded in a macroscopically homogeneous shear or mixed flow field. We demonstrate how the inertia results reduce to their noninertia counterparts in the nontrivial limit of vanishing mass. While the results are derived using basic integrations over Dirac delta distributions, we mention its relationship with alternative approaches involving (i) Fourier transforms, that seems advantageous only if the measured quantities also reside in Fourier space, and (ii) a Fokker--Planck equation and the moments of the probability distribution. The results, verified by numerical experiments, provide additional means of measuring the performance of numerical methods for such systems. It should be emphasized that this manuscript provides specific details regarding the derivations of the time correlation functions as well as the implementations of various numerical methods, so that it can serve as a standalone piece as part of education in the framework of stochastic differential equations and calculus.",

    "abstract": "A referendum to recall President Hugo Ch\\'{a}vez was held in Venezuela in August of 2004. In the referendum, voters were to vote YES if they wished to recall the President and NO if they wanted him to continue in office. The official results were 59% NO and 41% YES. Even though the election was monitored by various international groups including the Organization of American States and the Carter Center (both of which declared that the referendum had been conducted in a free and transparent manner), the outcome of the election was questioned by other groups both inside and outside of Venezuela. The collection of manuscripts that comprise this issue of Statistical Science discusses the general topic of election forensics but also focuses on different statistical approaches to explore, post-election, whether irregularities in the voting, vote transmission or vote counting processes could be detected in the 2004 presidential recall referendum. In this introduction to the Venezuela issue, we discuss the more recent literature on post-election auditing, describe the institutional context for the 2004 Venezuelan referendum, and briefly introduce each of the five contributions.",
