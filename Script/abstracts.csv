1,Synergetics and Its Application to Literature and Architecture,"V. P. Maslov, T. V. Maslova","nlin.AO, physics.soc-ph","A series of phenomena pertaining to economics, quantum physics, language, literary criticism, and especially architecture is studied from the standpoint of synergetics (the study of self-organizing complex systems). It turns out that a whole series of concrete formulas describing these phenomena is identical in these different situations. This is the case of formulas relating to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles and the distribution of words from a frequency dictionary. This also allows to apply a ""quantized"" from of the Zipf law to the problem of the authorship of 'Quiet Flows the Don' and to the""blending in"" of new architectural structures in an existing environment."
2,Analyzing Walter Skeat's Forty-Five Parallel Extracts of William   Langland's Piers Plowman,Roger Bilisoly,"stat.AP, cs.CL","Walter Skeat published his critical edition of William Langland's 14th century alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he located forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts from each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these excerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition. First, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line, which is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of the arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain subset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string variance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean. Third, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a clustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal is to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic."
3,BourbOulipo. Relazioni tra Oulipo e Bourbaki,"Elena Toscano, M. Alessandra Vaccaro",math.HO,"The theme of the influence of Bourbaki's ideas and methodologies on disciplines that transcend the mathematical field has been frequently addressed and, in particular, the reflection on the relationship between Bourbaki and Oulipo has animated a passionate debate within literary criticism. The purpose of this contribution is to investigate the relations between Le Lionnais, Queneau and Roubaud - and more generally Oulipo - and Bourbaki. Through a comparative examination between the two groups, the existence of an undeniable charisma of the ""polycephalic mathematician"" on the artistic-literary movement was highlighted."
4,The Science Wars: a pox on both their houses,Stephen Boughn,physics.hist-ph,"According to physicist David Mermin, the science wars was a series of exchanges between scientists and ""sociologists, historians, and literary critics"" whom the scientists thought to be ""ludicrously ignorant of science, making all kinds of nonsensical pronouncements."" The science wars peaked in 1996 with the publication of a hoax article by physicist Alan Sokal in a cultural studies journal and then seemed mercifully to die away by the end of the 1990's. I recently noticed, however, that the kerfuffle has persisted. This motivated me to pen this essay and point out the silliness of the entire affair."
5,Edgar Allan Poe: the first man to conceive a Newtonian evolving Universe,"Paolo Molaro, Alberto Cappi","physics.hist-ph, astro-ph.CO","The notion that we live in an evolving universe was established only in the twentieth century with the discovery of the recession of galaxies by Hubble and with the Lemaitre and Friedmann's interpretation in the 1920s.   However, the concept of an evolving universe is intrinsically tied to the law of universal gravitation, and it is surprising that it remained unrecognized for more than two centuries. A remarkable exception to this lack of awareness is represented by Poe. In Eureka (1848), the writer developed a conception of an evolving universe following the reasoning that a physical universe cannot be static and nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other. Unfortunately this literary work was, and still is, very little understood both by the literary critics and scientists of the time. We will discuss Poe's cosmological views in their historical scientific context, highlighting the remarkable insights of the writer, such as those dealing with the Olbers paradox, the existence of other galaxies and of a multi-universe."
6,On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems,"Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau","physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, math.PR","Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies (""stemmata""), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic ""biodiversity"" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance (""drift"") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation."
7,Derivatives of the tree function,Matthieu Josuat-Verg√®s,math.CO,"We study some sequences of polynomials that appear when we consider the successive derivatives of the tree function (or Lambert's W function). We show in particular that they are related with a generalization of Cayley trees, called Greg trees. Besides the combinatorial result in itself, it is interesting to see how this is related with previous work: similar problems were considered first by Ramanujan, and more recently in the theory of completely monotonic functions and its link with probability. Also of great interest is the fact that these Greg trees were introduced in a problem of textual criticism, as a kind a genealogical trees, where they had a priori no mathematical meaning."
8,Classical Philology. Notes on Fermat's way of thinking,V. Pizzigoni,"math.HO, 01A45",This study use some philological and historical means in order to understand Fermat's way of thinking.
9,Provenance of the Cross Sign of 806 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A   possible Lunar Halo over Continental Europe?,"Yuta Uchikawa, Les Cowley, Hisashi Hayakawa, David M. Willis, F. Richard Stephenson","physics.hist-ph, astro-ph.EP, physics.ao-ph, physics.geo-ph","While graphical records of astronomical/meteorological events before telescopic observations are of particular interest, they have frequently undergone multiple copying and may have been modified from the original. Here, we analyze a graphical record of the cross-sign of 806 CE in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which has been considered one of the earliest datable halo drawings in British records, whereas another cross-sign in 776 CE has been associated with the aurora. However, philological studies have revealed the later 806 event is derived from Continental annals. Here, records and drawings for the 806 event have been philologically traced back to mid-9th Century Continental manuscripts and the probable observational site identified as the area of Sens in northern France. The possible lunar halos at that time have been comprehensively examined by numerical ray tracing. Combined with calculations of twilight sky brightness, they identify a visibility window supporting monastic observation. Cruciform halos are shown to be fainter and rarer than brighter and more commonplace lunar halos. Physically credible cloud ice crystal variations can reproduce all the manuscript renditions. The manuscript records prove less than desirable detail but what is presented is fully consistent with a lunar halo interpretation. Finally, the possible societal impacts of such celestial events have been mentioned in the context of contemporary coins in Anglo-Saxon England and the Carolingian Empire. These analyses show that we need to trace their provenance back as far as possible, to best reconstruct the original event, even if graphical records are available for given astronomical/meteorological events."
10,From Past to Future: Digital Methods Towards Artefact Analysis,"Andrew Harris, Andrea Cremaschi, Tse Siang Lim, Maria De Iorio, Kwa Chong Guan",stat.AP,"Over the past two decades, Digital Humanities has transformed the landscape of humanities and social sciences, enabling advanced computational analysis and interpretation of extensive datasets. Notably, recent initiatives in Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore, focus on categorising and archiving historical data such as artwork, literature and, most notably archaeological artefacts. This study illustrates the profound potential of Digital Humanities through the application of statistical methods on two distinct artefact datasets. Specifically, we present the results of an automated die study on mid-1st millennium AD ""Rising Sun"" coinage from mainland Southeast Asia, while subsequently utilising unsupervised statistical methods on 2D images of 13th-14th century earthenware ceramics excavated from the precolonial St. Andrew's Cathedral site in central Singapore. This research offers a comparative assessment showcasing the transformative impact of statistics-based approaches on the interpretation and analysis of diverse archaeological materials and within Digital Humanities overall."
11,Tables in Leibniz: a challenge for the digital humanities,Ariles Remaki,math.HO,"Leibniz's mathematical texts are a perfect example of a type of historical document that is extremely difficult to deal with in the context of an editorial enterprise: the draft. The tables in Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts are a particularly good example of these difficulties, as they are equivocal sources containing many implicit operations. The publication of these texts raises the question of the nature of these signs and the economy of implicit relationships between their various components. Peirce's semiological approach provides the philosophical ground for these reflections, while Michel Serres's structuralism is a fertile source of inspiration. The digital tool holds much promise for many issues, including the particular difficulties of tables. We will show that it can be implemented by different computer structures which largely determine the way the historian conceives them a priori but also the way the reader receives them a posteriori. Finally, the tables are the simple case that founds a general problematic on the interpretation of many manuscripts and allows us to study the problem of the writing process at its root."
12,The cosmology of the Divine Comedy,Alejandro Gangui,"physics.hist-ph, astro-ph","Since the time of ancient civilizations, cosmology had a privileged place within the various artistic and literary manifestations. The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, one of the masterpieces in literature and thought of the Western World, is organized on the image of the cosmos of the XIII century, which is analyzed in this article."
13,"Statistics of punctuation in experimental literature -- the remarkable   case of ""Finnegans Wake"" by James Joyce","Tomasz Stanisz, Stanis≈Çaw Dro≈ºd≈º, Jaros≈Çaw Kwapie≈Ñ","physics.soc-ph, cs.CL, stat.AP","As the recent studies indicate, the structure imposed onto written texts by the presence of punctuation develops patterns which reveal certain characteristics of universality. In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. ""Finnegans Wake"" - the same one to which science owes the word ""quarks"" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is ""Finnegans Wake""."
14,Through the eyes of a reader and science communicator: science in the   mainstream and in the genre literature of yesterday and today,Valentin D. Ivanov,"physics.soc-ph, astro-ph.IM, physics.ed-ph","For most writers the science is either an exotic setting or a source of thrilling conflict that would drive the story forward. For a communicator it is the other way around - the science is neatly wrapped in a package of literary tools that make it ""invisible"" while it remains tangible and most importantly - it can be conveyed to the reader in understandable terms. There are many examples showing how these seemingly contradicting goals can complement each other successfully. I will review how the science was communicated by mainstream and genre writers of yesterday and today, and in different (not necessarily anglophone) cultures. I will bring forward the best and the worst examples that illuminate various astronomical concepts. Finally, I will discuss how we can use them both in outreach and education. Contrary to many similar summaries I will concentrate on some often overlooked mainstream literary examples, including the plays The Physicists by Friedrich D\""urrenmatt and Copenhagen by Michael Frayn, the novel White Garments by Vl. Dudintsev and even an episode of the Inspector Morse TV show, featuring scientists. I will also mention in passing a few less well known genre books."
15,Temporal Network Analysis of Literary Texts,"Sandra D. Prado, Silvio R. Dahmen, Ana L. C. Bazzan, Padraig Mac Carron, Ralph Kenna","physics.soc-ph, cs.CL","We study temporal networks of characters in literature focusing on ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (1865) by Lewis Carroll and the anonymous ""La Chanson de Roland"" (around 1100). The former, one of the most influential pieces of nonsense literature ever written, describes the adventures of Alice in a fantasy world with logic plays interspersed along the narrative. The latter, a song of heroic deeds, depicts the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 A.D. during Charlemagne's campaign on the Iberian Peninsula. We apply methods recently developed by Taylor and coworkers \cite{Taylor+2015} to find time-averaged eigenvector centralities, Freeman indices and vitalities of characters. We show that temporal networks are more appropriate than static ones for studying stories, as they capture features that the time-independent approaches fail to yield."
16,Mathematical Symbolism in a Russian Literary Masterpiece,"Noah Giansiracusa, Anastasia Vasilyeva","math.HO, 01A72, 00A30","Andrei Bely's modernist novel ""Petersburg,"" first published in 1913, is considered a pinnacle of the Symbolist movement. Nabokov famously ranked it as one of the four greatest masterpieces of 20th-century prose. The author's father, Bugaev, was an influential mathematician and for 12 years served as the president of the Moscow Mathematical Society; he was also a source of inspiration for one of the main characters in the son's novel. While the philosophical views and political leanings of the mathematicians surrounding Bely, and their impact on ""Petersburg,"" have been a topic of recent academic interest, there has not yet been a direct investigation of the surprisingly frequent and sophisticated mathematical passages in the book itself. We attempt here to rectify this gap in the scholarly literature, and in doing so find a rich tapestry of mathematical ideas and allusions."
17,Network analysis of the Kyiv bylyny cycle -- east Slavic epic narratives,"Petro Sarkanych, Nazar Fedorak, Yurij Holovatch, P√°draig MacCarron, Joseph Yose, Ralph Kenna","physics.soc-ph, cs.SI","In recent times, the advent of network science permitted new quantitative approaches to literary studies. Here we bring the Kyiv bylyny cycle into the field - East Slavic epic narratives originating in modern-day Ukraine. By comparing them to other prominent European epics, we identify universal and distinguishing properties of the social networks in bylyny. We analyse community structures and rank the most important characters. The method allows to bolster hypotheses from humanities literature - such as the position of Prince Volodymyr - and to generate new ones We show how the Kyiv cycle of bylyny fits very well with narrative networks from other nations - especially heroic ones. We anticipate that, besides delivering new narratological insights, this study will aid future scholars and interested public to navigate their way through Ukraine's epic story and identify its heroes."
18,"Parametric density-based optimization of partition in cluster analysis,   with applications","E. Ostrovsky, L. Sirota, A. Zeldin","math.ST, stat.TH","We developed an optimal in the natural sense algorithm of partition in cluster analysis based on the densities of observations in the different hypotheses. These densities may be characterized, for instance, as the multivariate so-called ""quasi-Gaussian distribution"".   We describe also the possible applications in technical diagnosis, demography and philology."
19,"Rate of convergence in the maximum likelihood estimation for partial   discrete parameter, with applications to the cluster analysis and philology","E. Ostrovsky, L. Sirota, A. Zeldin","math.ST, stat.TH",The problem of estimation of the distribution parameters on the sample when the part of these parameters are discrete (e.g. integer) is considered. We prove that the rate of convergence of MLE estimates under the natural conditions on the distribution density is exponentially fast.
20,Singularities,Alan H. Durfee,math.AG,"This article recounts the interaction of topology and singularity theory (mainly singularities of complex algebraic varieties) which started in the early part of this century and bloomed in the 1960's with the work of Hirzebruch, Brieskorn, Milnor and others. Some of the topics are followed to the present day. (A chapter for the book ""History of Topology"", ed. I. M. James)"
21,The ontogeny of discourse structure mimics the development of literature,"Natalia Bezerra Mota, Sylvia Pinheiro, Mariano Sigman, Diego Fernandez Slezak, Guillermo Cecchi, Mauro Copelli, Sidarta Ribeiro","q-bio.NC, cs.CL, physics.soc-ph","Discourse varies with age, education, psychiatric state and historical epoch, but the ontogenetic and cultural dynamics of discourse structure remain to be quantitatively characterized. To this end we investigated word graphs obtained from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning ~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically, discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from randomness."
22,Advancing Zero-Shot Digital Human Quality Assessment through   Text-Prompted Evaluation,"Zicheng Zhang, Wei Sun, Yingjie Zhou, Haoning Wu, Chunyi Li, Xiongkuo Min, Xiaohong Liu, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin","eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.DB","Digital humans have witnessed extensive applications in various domains, necessitating related quality assessment studies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive digital human quality assessment (DHQA) databases. To address this gap, we propose SJTU-H3D, a subjective quality assessment database specifically designed for full-body digital humans. It comprises 40 high-quality reference digital humans and 1,120 labeled distorted counterparts generated with seven types of distortions. The SJTU-H3D database can serve as a benchmark for DHQA research, allowing evaluation and refinement of processing algorithms. Further, we propose a zero-shot DHQA approach that focuses on no-reference (NR) scenarios to ensure generalization capabilities while mitigating database bias. Our method leverages semantic and distortion features extracted from projections, as well as geometry features derived from the mesh structure of digital humans. Specifically, we employ the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to measure semantic affinity and incorporate the Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) model to capture low-level distortion information. Additionally, we utilize dihedral angles as geometry descriptors to extract mesh features. By aggregating these measures, we introduce the Digital Human Quality Index (DHQI), which demonstrates significant improvements in zero-shot performance. The DHQI can also serve as a robust baseline for DHQA tasks, facilitating advancements in the field. The database and the code are available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/SJTU-H3D."
23,Statistical Properties of European Languages and Voynich Manuscript   Analysis,"Andronik Arutyunov, Leonid Borisov, Sergey Fedorov, Anastasiya Ivchenko, Elizabeth Kirina-Lilinskaya, Yurii Orlov, Konstantin Osminin, Sergey Shilin, Dmitriy Zeniuk","stat.AP, cs.CL",The statistical properties of letters frequencies in European literature texts are investigated. The determination of logarithmic dependence of letters sequence for one-language and two-language texts are examined. The pare of languages is suggested for Voynich Manuscript. The internal structure of Manuscript is considered. The spectral portraits of two-letters distribution are constructed.
24,Entropic analysis of the role of words in literary texts,"Marcelo A. Montemurro, Damian H. Zanette","cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.CL","Beyond the local constraints imposed by grammar, words concatenated in long sequences carrying a complex message show statistical regularities that may reflect their linguistic role in the message. In this paper, we perform a systematic statistical analysis of the use of words in literary English corpora. We show that there is a quantitative relation between the role of content words in literary English and the Shannon information entropy defined over an appropriate probability distribution. Without assuming any previous knowledge about the syntactic structure of language, we are able to cluster certain groups of words according to their specific role in the text."
25,Competition between Two Kinds of Correlations in Literary Texts,"S. S. Melnyk, O. V. Usatenko, V. A. Yampol'skii, V. A. Golick","physics.data-an, physics.gen-ph","A theory of additive Markov chains with long-range memory is used for description of correlation properties of coarse-grained literary texts. The complex structure of the correlations in texts is revealed. Antipersistent correlations at small distances, L < 300, and persistent ones at L > 300 define this nontrivial structure. For some concrete examples of literary texts, the memory functions are obtained and their power-law behavior at long distances is disclosed. This property is shown to be a cause of self-similarity of texts with respect to the decimation procedure."
26,Fractional Integral Inequalities via s-Convex Functions,"M. Emin Ozdemir, Havva Kavurmaci, Cetin Yildiz",math.CA,"In this paper, we establish several inequalities for s-convex mappings that are connected with the Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals. Our results have some relationships with certain integral inequalities in the literature."
27,A Networks-Science Investigation into the Epic Poems of Ossian,"Joseph Yose, Ralph Kenna, P√°draig MacCarron, Thierry Platini, Justin Tonra",physics.soc-ph,"In 1760 James Macpherson published the first volume of a series of epic poems which he claimed to have translated into English from ancient Scottish-Gaelic sources. The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Sen\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology."
28,Measuring Large Scale Space Perception in Literary Texts,Paolo Rossi,"math.ST, stat.TH","The center and radius of perception associated with a written text are defined, and algorithms for their computation are presented. Indicators for anisotropy in large scale space perception are introduced. The relevance of these notions for the analysis of literary and historical records is briefly discussed and illustrated with an example taken from medieval historiography."
29,Fractal Power Law in Literary English,"L. L. Goncalves, L. B. Goncalves","cond-mat.other, physics.soc-ph","We present in this paper a numerical investigation of literary texts by various well-known English writers, covering the first half of the twentieth century, based upon the results obtained through corpus analysis of the texts. A fractal power law is obtained for the lexical wealth defined as the ratio between the number of different words and the total number of words of a given text. By considering as a signature of each author the exponent and the amplitude of the power law, and the standard deviation of the lexical wealth, it is possible to discriminate works of different genres and writers and show that each writer has a very distinct signature, either considered among other literary writers or compared with writers of non-literary texts. It is also shown that, for a given author, the signature is able to discriminate between short stories and novels."
30,Fractal Illusions: An Experimental Study of Long-Range Sentence-Length   Correlations in Randomly Generated Natural Language Texts,"Ying Zeng, Junying Cui, Lejun Li","nlin.CD, nlin.AO","This study re-evaluates the assumption that long-range correlations in sentence length are a fundamental feature of natural language and a marker of literary style. While previous research has suggested that punctuation marks--particularly full stops--generate structural regularities in narrative texts, our experiments challenge this view. Using Chinese as the primary language, supplemented with English, we constructed randomized linguistic sequences through three distinct methods. Surprisingly, these randomized texts also exhibit long-range correlations in sentence length, some even with stronger fractal characteristics than those found in canonical literary works. These findings suggest that the presence of long-range correlations in sentence length is not sufficient to indicate authorial intention, structural depth, or literary value. We argue that punctuation-induced long-range correlations have limited value for literary stylistic analysis and cannot be considered a fundamental characteristic of human writing."
31,Characterization of quasy-Gaussian distributions,"E. Ostrovsky, L. Sirota, A. Zeldin","math.ST, stat.TH","A new characterization of the multivariate so-called ""quasi-Gaussian distribution"" (the authors dared to coin a new term) by means of independence their Cartesian and polar coordinates proposed.   The authors try to show that these distributions may essentially differ from the classical Gaussian distribution. Some properties of these distributions are studied: calculating of moments and of bilateral tail behavior. Some potential applications of these distributions and mixtures of the distributions in demography, philology are discussed in the final section."
32,Identification of Literary Movements Using Complex Networks to Represent   Texts,"Diego R. Amancio, Osvaldo N. Oliveira Jr., Luciano da F. Costa","physics.soc-ph, cs.SI, physics.data-an","The use of statistical methods to analyze large databases of text has been useful to unveil patterns of human behavior and establish historical links between cultures and languages. In this study, we identify literary movements by treating books published from 1590 to 1922 as complex networks, whose metrics were analyzed with multivariate techniques to generate six clusters of books. The latter correspond to time periods coinciding with relevant literary movements over the last 5 centuries. The most important factor contributing to the distinction between different literary styles was {the average shortest path length (particularly, the asymmetry of the distribution)}. Furthermore, over time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths, which is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use of the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution of word frequency. Changes in literary style were also found to be driven by opposition to earlier writing styles, as revealed by the analysis performed with geometrical concepts. The approaches adopted here are generic and may be extended to analyze a number of features of languages and cultures."
33,Lectures on Symplectic Field Theory,Chris Wendl,"math.SG, 53D42 (Primary), 32Q65, 57R17 (Secondary)","This is the preliminary manuscript of a book on symplectic field theory based on a lecture course for PhD students given in 2015-16. It covers the essentials of the analytical theory of punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, taking the opportunity to fill in gaps in the existing literature where necessary, and then gives detailed explanations of a few of the standard applications in contact topology such as distinguishing contact structures up to contactomorphism and proving symplectic non-fillability."

35,Infinite Maxwell fisheye as a complement for an imaging device,"Yangjie Liu, Huanyang Chen",physics.optics,\noindent This manuscript proposes a new imaging medium via isotropic refractive index of heterogeneous medium. We exploit conformal-map to transfers the full Maxwell fisheye into a mapped profile within a unit circle. The imaging resolution of this new profile can be maintained as good as the mirrored Maxwell fisheye profile or its conformally-mapped counterpart in previous literature.

As a corollary we clarify the relation between different renormalizations at non-positive values appearing in the recent literature.
37,Tree balance indices: a comprehensive survey,"Mareike Fischer, Lina Herbst, Sophie Kersting, Luise K√ºhn, Kristina Wicke","q-bio.PE, math.CO, 05C05, 05C35, 92E99, 05C90, G.2.2; G.2.1; G.4","Tree balance plays an important role in phylogenetics and other research areas, which is why several indices to measure tree balance have been introduced over the years. Nevertheless, a formal definition of what a balance index actually is and what makes it a useful measure of balance (or, in other cases, imbalance), has so far not been introduced in the literature. While the established indices all summarize the (im)balance of a tree in a single number, they vary in their definitions and underlying principles. It is the aim of the present manuscript to introduce formal definitions of balance and imbalance indices that classify desirable properties of such indices and to analyze and categorize established indices accordingly. In this regard, we review 19 established (im)balance indices from the literature, summarize their general, statistical and combinatorial properties (where known), prove numerous additional results and indicate directions for future research by making explicit open questions and gaps in the literature. We also prove that a few tree shape statistics that have been used to measure tree balance in the literature do not fulfill our definition of an (im)balance index, which might indicate that their properties are not as useful for practical purposes. Moreover, we show that five additional tree shape statistics from other contexts actually are tree (im)balance indices according to our definition. The manuscript is accompanied by the website \url{treebalance.wordpress.com} containing fact sheets of the discussed indices. Moreover, we introduce the software package \verb|treebalance| implemented in $\mathsf{R}$ that can be used to calculate all indices discussed."

  65D10, 65D17","Fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) developed through iterated function systems (IFSs) prove more versatile than classical interpolants. However, the applications of FIFs in the domain of `shape preserving interpolation' are not fully addressed so far. Among various techniques available in the classical numerical analysis, rational interpolation schemes are well suited for the shape preservation problems and shape modification analysis. In this paper, the capability of FIFs to generalize smooth classical interpolants, and the effectiveness of rational function models in shape preservation are intertwingly exploited to provide a new solution to the shape preserving interpolation problem in fractal perspective. As a common platform for these two techniques to work together, we introduce rational cubic spline FIFs involving tension parameters for the first time in literature. Suitable conditions on parameters of the associated IFS are developed so that the rational fractal interpolant inherits fundamental shape properties such as monotonicity, convexity, and positivity present in the given data. With some suitable hypotheses on the original function, the convergence analysis of the $\mathcal{C}^1$-rational cubic spline FIF is carried out. Due to the presence of the scaling factors in the rational cubic spline fractal interpolant, our approach generalizes the classical results on the shape preserving rational interpolation by Delbourgo and Gregory [SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 6 (1985), pp. 967-976]. The effectiveness of the shape preserving interpolation schemes are illustrated with suitably chosen numerical examples and graphs, which support the practical utility of our methods."
42,The establishment of static digital humans and the integration with   spinal models,"Fujiao Ju, Yuxuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Chengyin Wang, Yinbo Chen, Jianfeng Li, Mingjie Dong, Bin Fang, Qianyu Zhuang","eess.IV, cs.CV","Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent spinal deformity, significantly affects individuals' health and quality of life. Conventional imaging techniques, such as X - rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer static views of the spine. However, they are restricted in capturing the dynamic changes of the spine and its interactions with overall body motion. Therefore, developing new techniques to address these limitations has become extremely important. Dynamic digital human modeling represents a major breakthrough in digital medicine. It enables a three - dimensional (3D) view of the spine as it changes during daily activities, assisting clinicians in detecting deformities that might be missed in static imaging. Although dynamic modeling holds great potential, constructing an accurate static digital human model is a crucial initial step for high - precision simulations. In this study, our focus is on constructing an accurate static digital human model integrating the spine, which is vital for subsequent dynamic digital human research on AIS. First, we generate human point - cloud data by combining the 3D Gaussian method with the Skinned Multi - Person Linear (SMPL) model from the patient's multi - view images. Then, we fit a standard skeletal model to the generated human model. Next, we align the real spine model reconstructed from CT images with the standard skeletal model. We validated the resulting personalized spine model using X - ray data from six AIS patients, with Cobb angles (used to measure the severity of scoliosis) as evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the model's error was within 1 degree of the actual measurements. This study presents an important method for constructing digital humans."
43,Feasibility of 3D reconstructions from a single 2D diffraction   measurement,Pierre Thibault,"physics.data-an, physics.optics","We comment on the recent manuscript by Raines et al. [arXiv:0905.0269v2] (now published in Nature, vol. 463, p. 214-217, 2010), which suggests that in certain conditions a single diffraction measurement may be sufficient to reconstruct the full three-dimensional density of a scatterer. We show that past literature contains the tools to assess rigorously the feasibility of this approach. We question the formulation of the reconstruction algorithm used by the authors and we argue that the experimental data used as a demonstration is not suitable for this method, and thus that the reconstruction is not valid.   This second version was produced for documentation purposes. In addition to the minimally modified original comment, it includes in appendix a subsequent reply to one of the authors (J. Miao)."

However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies."
45,Some New Bounds on the Entropy Numbers of Diagonal Operators,Simon Fischer,"math.FA, 47B06, 46B45","Entropy numbers are an important tool for quantifying the compactness of operators. Besides establishing new upper bounds on the entropy numbers of diagonal operators $D_\sigma$ from $\ell_p$ to $\ell_q$, where $p\not=q$, we investigate the optimality of these bounds. In case of $p<q$ optimality is proven for fast decaying diagonal sequences, which include exponentially decreasing sequences. In case of $p>q$ we show optimality under weaker assumption than previously used in the literature. In addition, we illustrate the benefit of our results with examples not covered in the literature so far."

Inspired by the work of Weber ""Probabilistic values for games"", we establish the new theory step by step, following the classical axiomatization, i.e. using the linearity axiom, the dummy axiom, etc.   Furthermore, we define Shapley values on simplicial complexes generalizing the classical notion in literature. Remarkably, the traditional axiomatization of Shapley values can be extended to this general setting for a rather interesting class of complexes that generalize the notion of vertex-transitive graphs and vertex-homogeneous simplicial complexes. These combinatorial objects are very popular in the literature because of the study of Evasiveness Conjecture in Complexity Theory."
47,Complex network analysis of literary and scientific texts,"Iwona Grabska-Gradzinska, Andrzej Kulig, Jaroslaw Kwapien, Stanislaw Drozdz",physics.soc-ph,"We present results from our quantitative study of statistical and network properties of literary and scientific texts written in two languages: English and Polish. We show that Polish texts are described by the Zipf law with the scaling exponent smaller than the one for the English language. We also show that the scientific texts are typically characterized by the rank-frequency plots with relatively short range of power-law behavior as compared to the literary texts. We then transform the texts into their word-adjacency network representations and find another difference between the languages. For the majority of the literary texts in both languages, the corresponding networks revealed the scale-free structure, while this was not always the case for the scientific texts. However, all the network representations of texts were hierarchical. We do not observe any qualitative and quantitative difference between the languages. However, if we look at other network statistics like the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length, the English texts occur to possess more clustered structure than do the Polish ones. This result was attributed to differences in grammar of both languages, which was also indicated in the Zipf plots. All the texts, however, show network structure that differs from any of the Watts-Strogatz, the Barabasi-Albert, and the Erdos-Renyi architectures."

In this work, we propose an approach to synthesise poems with almost human like naturalness in order to enable literary scholars to systematically examine hypotheses on the interplay between text, spoken realisation, and the listener's perception of poems. To meet these special requirements for literary studies, we resynthesise poems by cloning prosodic values from a human reference recitation, and afterwards make use of fine-grained prosody control to manipulate the synthetic speech in a human-in-the-loop setting to alter the recitation w.r.t. specific phenomena. We find that finetuning our TTS model on poetry captures poetic intonation patterns to a large extent which is beneficial for prosody cloning and manipulation and verify the success of our approach both in an objective evaluation as well as in human studies."
49,Good practices for a literature survey are not followed by authors while   preparing scientific manuscripts,"D. R. Amancio, M. G. V. Nunes, O. N. Oliveira Jr., L. da F. Costa","physics.soc-ph, cs.DL","The number of citations received by authors in scientific journals has become a major parameter to assess individual researchers and the journals themselves through the impact factor. A fair assessment therefore requires that the criteria for selecting references in a given manuscript should be unbiased with respect to the authors or the journals cited. In this paper, we advocate that authors should follow two mandatory principles to select papers (later reflected in the list of references) while studying the literature for a given research: i) consider similarity of content with the topics investigated, lest very related work should be reproduced or ignored; ii) perform a systematic search over the network of citations including seminal or very related papers. We use formalisms of complex networks for two datasets of papers from the arXiv repository to show that neither of these two criteria is fulfilled in practice."
50,Multichannel adaptive signal detection: Basic theory and literature   review,"Weijian Liu, Jun Liu, Chengpeng Hao, Yongchan Gao, Yong-Liang Wang",stat.AP,"Multichannel adaptive signal detection jointly uses the test and training data to form an adaptive detector, and then make a decision on whether a target exists or not. Remarkably, the resulting adaptive detectors usually possess the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) properties, and hence no additional CFAR processing is needed. Filtering is not needed as a processing procedure either, since the function of filtering is embedded in the adaptive detector. Moreover, adaptive detection usually exhibits better detection performance than the filtering-then-CFAR detection technique. Multichannel adaptive signal detection has been more than 30 years since the first multichannel adaptive detector was proposed by Kelly in 1986. However, there are fewer overview articles on this topic. In this paper we give a tutorial overview of multichannel adaptive signal detection, with emphasis on Gaussian background. We present the main deign criteria for adaptive detectors, investigate the relationship between adaptive detection and filtering-then-CFAR detection, relationship between adaptive detectors and adaptive filters, summarize typical adaptive detectors, show numerical examples, give comprehensive literature review, and discuss some possible further research tracks."
51,On measuring colloidal volume fractions,"Wilson C. K. Poon, Eric R. Weeks, C. Patrick Royall",cond-mat.soft,"Hard-sphere colloids are popular as models for testing fundamental theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation, researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as 0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6% are probably unavoidable. The consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion."
52,"Schoolyard Greening, Child Health, and Neighborhood Change: A   Comparative Study of Urban U.S. Cities",Mahshid Gorjian,physics.soc-ph,"Background: Schoolyard greening has emerged as an innovative approach to enhancing childrens health and environmental equity in urban U.S. cities. Yet, the implications for neighborhood dynamics and social equity are insufficiently understood. Methods: This comparative literature review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative evidence from peer reviewed studies and case analyses of schoolyard greening in major U.S. cities. Results: Schoolyard greening consistently increases utilization and has a positive, though variable, effect on childrens physical activity and well-being. However, the benefits are not always equitably distributed, and greening projects can catalyze neighborhood change, sometimes leading to green gentrification. Conclusions: Greening urban schoolyards offers benefits for childrens health and urban sustainability but poses challenges for equity and social justice. Policies must prioritize inclusive, community driven approaches to ensure the gains of greening are shared by vulnerable populations."

Arany-Prado",astro-ph,"The purpose of this work is to resume investigation of Galactic thin disk dating using nucleocosmochronology with Th/Eu stellar abundance ratios, a theme absent from the literature since 1990. [Th/Eu] abundance ratios for a sample of 20 disk dwarfs/subgiants of F5 to G8 spectral type with -0.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3, determined in the first paper of this series, were adopted for this analysis. We developed a Galactic chemical evolution model that includes the effect of refuses, which are composed of stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) and low-mass stellar formation residues (terrestrial planets, comets, etc.), contributing to a better fit to observational constraints. Two Galactic disk ages were estimated, by comparing literature data on Th/Eu production and solar abundance ratios to the model ((8.7 +5.8-4.1) Gyr), and by comparing [Th/Eu] vs. [Fe/H] curves from the model to our stellar abundance ratio data ((8.2 +/- 1.9) Gyr), yielding the final, average value (8.3 +/- 1.8) Gyr. This is the first Galactic disk age determined via Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology, and corroborates the most recent white dwarf ages determined via cooling sequence calculations, which indicate a low age (<~ 10 Gyr) for the disk."

55,Translating scientific Latin texts with artificial intelligence: the   works of Euler and contemporaries,Sylvio R. Bistafa,"math.HO, cs.CL, physics.ed-ph","The major hindrance in the study of earlier scientific literature is the availability of Latin translations into modern languages. This is particular true for the works of Euler who authored about 850 manuscripts and wrote a thousand letters and received back almost two thousand more. The translation of many of these manuscripts, books and letters have been published in various sources over the last two centuries, but many more have not yet appeared. Fortunately, nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) translation can be used to circumvent the challenges of translating such substantial number of texts. To validate this tool, benchmark tests have been performed to compare the performance of two popular AI translating algorithms, namely Google Translate and ChatGPT. Additional tests were accomplished in translating an excerpt of a 1739 letter from Johann Bernoulli to Euler, where he announces that he was sending Euler the first part of his manuscript Hydraulica. Overall, the comparative results show that ChatGPT performed better that Google Translate not only in the benchmark tests but also in the translation of this letter, highlighting the superiority of ChatGPT as a translation tool, catering not only to general Latin practitioners but also proving beneficial for specialized Latin translators."
56,The fourth Dimension,Eugen Schweitzer,"physics.gen-ph, physics.hist-ph","In different passages of his dialogues, Plato showed deep mathematically-based physical insights. Regrettably most readers overlooked the respective statements, or they utterly did not understand those hints since they were full of philological fallacious terms. Respectable translators misinterpreted such statements and therefore Plato's respective remarks were not recognized as substantial knowledge. Furthermore, Plato often supplemented such basic remarks by diffusely veiled and varied allusions that were often ironically hidden somewhere in his dialogues by inconspicuous double meanings. However, this mode of intentionally coded discrete communication was generally not understood because such irony is not to everyone's taste. However, the attempts to reconstruct Plato's system on the basis of admittedly individually interpreted double meanings lead to a conclusive mathematical-physical cyclical system of dimensions. Additionally it was possible to assign Plato's system of philosophical ideas analogously to this cyclical system. Plato took the verifiability of the mathematical-physical results as proof of the system of his ideas and finally as proof of his ethical creed, the unconditional trust in the 'all surmounting Good.'"

58,On the monotone metric of classical channel and distribution spaces:   asymptotic theory,Keiji Matsumoto,quant-ph,"The aim of the manuscript is to characterize monotone metric in the space of Markov map. Here, metric may not be Riemanian, or equivalently, may not be induced from an inner product. So far, there have been plenty of literatures on the metric in the space of probability distributions and quantum states. Among them, Cencov and Petz characterized all the monotone metrics in the classical and quantum state space. As for channels, however, only a little is known about its geometrical structures. In that author's previous manuscript, the upper and the lower bound of monotone channel metric was derived using resource conversion theory, and it is proved that any monotone metric cannot be Riemanian. . Due to the latter result, we cannot rely on Cencov's theory, to build a geometric theory consistent across probability distributions and channels. To dispense with the assumption that a metric is Riemanian, we introduce some assumptions on asymptotic behavior;weak asymptotic additivity and lower asymptotic continuity. The proof utilizes resource conversion technique. In the end of the paper, an implication on quantum state metrics is discussed."

Unlike most other quantities quoted in astronomical literature, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is generally quoted with no attempt to estimate the errors on its value. This is a practice that would not be accepted for those other quantities, as it is often regarded that an estimate of a quantity without an estimate of its associated uncertainties is meaningless. This manuscript describes a number of easily implemented, Monte Carlo based methods to estimate the uncertainty on the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, or more precisely to estimate its probability distribution."
61,Universal Meshes for the Simulation of Brittle Fracture and Moving   Boundary Problems,"Maurizio M. Chiaramonte, Evan S. Gawlik, Hardik Kabaria, Adrian J. Lew",math.NA,"Universal meshes have recently appeared in the literature as a compu- tationally efficient and robust paradigm for the generation of conforming simpli- cial meshes for domains with evolving boundaries. The main idea behind a univer- sal mesh is to immerse the moving boundary in a background mesh (the universal mesh), and to produce a mesh that conforms to the moving boundary at any given time by adjusting a few of elements of the background mesh. In this manuscript we present the application of universal meshes to the simulation of brittle fracturing. To this extent, we provide a high level description of a crack propagation algorithm and showcase its capabilities. Alongside universal meshes for the simulation of brit- tle fracture, we provide other examples for which universal meshes prove to be a powerful tool, namely fluid flow past moving obstacles. Lastly, we conclude the manuscript with some remarks on the current state of universal meshes and future directions."

It has natural connotations to transition rates in multi-state models. The generalization from the forward mortality rate in a survival model to multi-state models is non-trivial and several definitions have been proposed. We establish a theoretical framework for the discussion of forward rates. Furthermore, we provide a novel definition with its own logic and merits and compare it with the proposals in the literature. The definition turns the Kolmogorov forward equations inside out by interchanging the transition probabilities with the transition intensities as the object to be calculated."

64,AVaN Pack: An Analytical/Numerical Solution for Variance-Based   Sensitivity Analysis,"Eduardo Vasconcelos, Adriano Souza, Kelvin Dias","stat.OT, cs.MS","Sensitivity analysis is an important concept to analyze the influences of parameters in a system, an equation or a collection of data. The methods used for sensitivity analysis are divided into deterministic and statistical techniques. Generally, deterministic techniques analyze fixed points of a model whilst stochastic techniques analyze a range of values. Deterministic methods fail in analyze the entire range of input values and stochastic methods generate outcomes with random errors. In this manuscript, we are interested in stochastic methods, mainly in variance-based techniques such as Variance and Sobol indices, since this class of techniques is largely used on literature. The objective of this manuscript is to present an analytical solution for variance based sensitive analysis. As a result of this research, two small programs were developed in Javascript named as AVaN Pack (Analysis of Variance through Numerical solution). These programs allow users to find the contribution of each individual parameter in any function by means of a mathematical solution, instead of sampling-based ones."

In this Ph.D manuscript, we revisit an approach based on the tools of statistical physics of disordered systems. Developed through a rich literature, they have been precisely designed to infer the macroscopic behavior of a large number of particles from their microscopic interactions. At the heart of this work, we strongly capitalize on the deep connection between the replica method and message passing algorithms in order to shed light on the phase diagrams of various theoretical models, with an emphasis on the potential differences between statistical and algorithmic thresholds. We essentially focus on synthetic tasks and data generated in the teacher-student paradigm. In particular, we apply these mean-field methods to the Bayes-optimal analysis of committee machines, to the worst-case analysis of Rademacher generalization bounds for perceptrons, and to empirical risk minimization in the context of generalized linear models. Finally, we develop a framework to analyze estimation models with structured prior informations, produced for instance by deep neural networks based generative models with random weights."
67,Variance matrix priors for Dirichlet process mixture models with   Gaussian kernels,"Wei Jing, Michail Papathomas, Silvia Liverani",stat.ME,"The Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) is a Bayesian non-parametric approach widely used for density estimation and clustering. In this manuscript, we study the choice of prior for the variance or precision matrix when Gaussian kernels are adopted. Typically, in the relevant literature, the assessment of mixture models is done by considering observations in a space of only a handful of dimensions. Instead, we are concerned with more realistic problems of higher dimensionality, in a space of up to 20 dimensions. We observe that the choice of prior is increasingly important as the dimensionality of the problem increases. After identifying certain undesirable properties of standard priors in problems of higher dimensionality, we review and implement possible alternative priors. The most promising priors are identified, as well as other factors that affect the convergence of MCMC samplers. Our results show that the choice of prior is critical for deriving reliable posterior inferences. This manuscript offers a thorough overview and comparative investigation into possible priors, with detailed guidelines for their implementation. Although our work focuses on the use of the DPMM in clustering, it is also applicable to density estimation."
68,Prediction of superconducting properties of materials based on machine   learning models,"Jie Hu, Yongquan Jiang, Yang Yan, Houchen Zuo","cond-mat.supr-con, cs.LG","The application of superconducting materials is becoming more and more widespread. Traditionally, the discovery of new superconducting materials relies on the experience of experts and a large number of ""trial and error"" experiments, which not only increases the cost of experiments but also prolongs the period of discovering new superconducting materials. In recent years, machine learning has been increasingly applied to materials science. Based on this, this manuscript proposes the use of XGBoost model to identify superconductors; the first application of deep forest model to predict the critical temperature of superconductors; the first application of deep forest to predict the band gap of materials; and application of a new sub-network model to predict the Fermi energy level of materials. Compared with our known similar literature, all the above algorithms reach state-of-the-art. Finally, this manuscript uses the above models to search the COD public dataset and identify 50 candidate superconducting materials with possible critical temperature greater than 90 K."
69,Sparse convex relaxations in polynomial optimization,"Gennadiy Averkov, Benjamin Peters, Sebastian Sager","math.OC, 90C23, 90C22, 90C26, 13J30","We present a novel, general, and unifying point of view on sparse approaches to polynomial optimization. Solving polynomial optimization problems to global optimality is a ubiquitous challenge in many areas of science and engineering. Historically, different approaches on how to solve nonconvex polynomial optimization problems based on convex relaxations have been developed in different scientific communities. Here, we introduce the concept of monomial patterns. A pattern determines what monomials are to be linked by convex constraints in a convex relaxation of a polynomial optimization problem. This concept helps to understand existing approaches from different schools of thought, to develop novel relaxation schemes, and to derive a flexible duality theory, which can be specialized to many concrete situations that have been considered in the literature. We unify different approaches to polynomial optimization including polyhedral approximations, dense semidefinite relaxations, SONC, SAGE, and TSSOS in a self-contained exposition. We also carry out computational experiments to demonstrate the practical advantages of a flexible usage of pattern-based sparse relaxations of polynomial optimization problems."

Integrating the current knowledge of animal flight, we propose to revisit the use of live animals to study physical phenomena. After a short description of the physics of flight, we examine the broad literature on animal flight focusing on studies of living animals. We start out reviewing the diverse animal species studied so far and then focus on the experimental techniques used to study them quantitatively. Our network analysis reveals how the three clades of animals performing powered flight - insects, birds and bats - are studied using substantially different combinations of measurement techniques. We then combine these insights with a new paradigm for increasing our physical understanding of flight. This paradigm relies on the concept of Animal Learning, where animals are used as probes to study fluid phenomena and variables involved in flight, harnessing their natural adaptability."

For the single photon emission, literature (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 (2018) 071301) dictates that the transition probabilities of two individual systems, such as an atom accelerating with respect to the mirror and its reverse, turn out to be equivalent under the exchange of the frequencies of atom and the field. Addressing the observational merit of such excitation process, a detectable probability ($P \sim 10^{-2}$) is also reported in the above literature. In the present manuscript our finding dictates that the simultaneous emission of dual photon instead of one, destroys the equivalence between the transition probabilities as reported in the above literature."
73,Some Bounds upon Nonextensivity Parameter Using the Appropriate   Generalized Distribution Functions,"Ugur Tirnakli, Fevzi Buyukkilic, Dogan Demirhan",cond-mat.stat-mech,"In this study, approximate generalized quantal distribution functions and their applications, which appeared in the literature so far, have been summarized. Making use of the generalized Planck radiation law, which have been obtained by the authors of the present manuscript [Physica A240 (1997) 657], some alternative bounds for the nonextensivity parameter $q$ has been estimated. It has been shown that these results are similar to those obtained by Tsallis et al. [Phys. Rev. E52 (1995) 1447] and by Plastino et al. [Phys. Lett. A207 (1995) 42]."
74,Random Walks on Figure Eight:From Polymers Through Chaos to Gravity and   Beyond,Arkady L. Kholodenko,cond-mat.stat-mech,"This paper is extended and broadly generalized version of earlier published rapid communication, Phys.Rev.E, Vol.58, R 5213 (1998). It also elaborates on some problems which were left unsolved or just mentioned in Physics Reports Vol.298, 251 (1998). Applications of the obtained results include (but not limited to) polymer physics, classical and quantum chaos, fractional Hall effect, dynamics of textures in liquid crystals and 2+1 gravity. The paper presents some self contained excerpts from mathematics(not discussed so far in physics literature)to facilitate the uninterrupted reading of the manuscript."
75,The black-body radiation in Tsallis statistics,"H. Chamati, A. Ts. Djankova, N. S. Tonchev",cond-mat.stat-mech,"Some results for the black-body radiation obtained in the context of the $q$-thermostatistics are analyzed on both thermodynamical and statistical-mechanical levels. Since the thermodynamic potentials can be expressed in terms of the Wright's special function an useful asymptotic expansion can be obtained. This allows the consideration of the problem away from the Boltzmann-Gibbs limit $q=1$. The role of non-extensivity, $q<1$, on the possible deviation from the Stefan-Boltzmann $T^{4}$ behavior is considered. The application of some approximation schemes widely used in the literature to analyze the cosmic radiation is discussed."
76,Comment on the diagonalization of Green functions,P. A. Henning,hep-ph,"Real-time thermal field theory is known in the two flavors ``closed-time path formalism'' and ``thermo field dynamics''. With a certain choice of parameters the full two-point functions of these models are identical, hence a scheme to diagonalize the Green function in one model can be applied to the other as well. This allows to compare the diagonalization schemes that have been discussed in the recent literature in order to select the simplest one. Such comparison speaks in favor of a diagonalization method which is motivated from thermo field dynamics."
77,Effective Lagrangians and Parity-Conserving Time-Reversal Violation at   Low Energies,"Jonathan Engel, Paul H. Frampton, Roxanne P. Springer","nucl-th, hep-ph","Using effective Lagrangians, we argue that any time-reversal-violating but parity-conserving effects are too small to be observed in flavor-conserving nuclear processes without dramatic improvement in experimental accuracy. In the process we discuss other arguments that have appeared in the literature."
78,Inelastic scattering of light by a cold trapped atom: Effects of the   quantum center-of-mass motion,"Marc Bienert, Wolfgang Merkel, Giovanna Morigi",quant-ph,"The light scattered by a cold trapped ion, which is in the stationary state of laser cooling, presents features due to the mechanical effects of atom-photon interaction. These features appear as additional peaks (sidebands) in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence. Among these sidebands the literature has discussed the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, namely the sidebands of the elastic peak. In this manuscript we show that the motion also gives rise to sidebands of the inelastic peaks. These are not always visible, but, as we show, can be measured in parameter regimes which are experimentally accessible."
79,Accuracy of the diffusion equation with extrapolated-boundary condition   for transmittance of light through a turbid medium,"J. C. J. Paasschens, M. J. M. de Jong, C. W. J. Beenakker",physics.optics,"The linear intensity profile of multiply scattered light in a slab geometry extrapolates to zero at a certain distance beyond the boundary. The diffusion equation with this ""extrapolated boundary condition"" has been used in the literature to obtain analytical formulas for the transmittance of light through the slab as a function of angle of incidence and refractive index. The accuracy of these formulas is determined by comparison with a numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for radiative transfer."
80,A note on the distribution of the partial correlation coefficient with   nonparametrically estimated marginal regressions,Wicher Bergsma,"math.ST, stat.TH","There has been much interest in the nonparametric testing of conditional independence in the econometric and statistical literature, but the simplest and potentially most useful method, based on the sample partial correlation, seems to have been overlooked, its distribution only having been investigated in some simple parametric instances. The present note shows that an easy to apply permutation test based on the sample partial correlation with nonparametrically estimated marginal regressions has good large and small sample properties."
81,Spontaneous polygonization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes:   perturbation analysis,"Weihua Mu, Zhongcan Ou-Yang","cond-mat.mes-hall, math-ph, math.MP","Spontaneous polygonization for a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been observed for about two decades. In present manuscript, this phenomenon is understood by the competition between cohesion energy (with lattice mismatching effect) and curvature elastic energy of tubes inside the MWCNTs. Based on a continuum elastic model and perturbation analysis, the crucial conditions for spontaneous polygonization of MWCNT is expressed by fundamental parameters of MWCNTs, which are in reasonable agreement with all relevant experiments and computer simulations reported in literatures. Present approach can be used in further studies of crossectional geometry-dependent properties of MWCNTs."
82,Tightly Circumscribed Regular Polygons,Richard J. Mathar,"math.MG, 51M20 (Primary) 51M09, 52B12, 11Y60 (Secondary)","A regular polygon circumscribing another regular polygon (with a different side number) may be tightened to minimize the difference of both areas. The manuscripts computes the optimum result under the restriction that both polygons are concentric, and obtains limits if the process is repeated in a two-dimensional Babuschka-doll fashion with side numbers increasing or decreasing by one or stepping through the prime numbers. The new aspect compared to the circumscription discussed in the literature so far is that further squeezing of the outer polygon is possible as we drop the requirement of drawing intermediate spacing circles between the polygon pairs."
83,Scale- versus Conformal Invariance Revisited,"Ivo Sachs, Dmitry Ponomarev",hep-th,For a scale invariant theory with gauge-invariant local virial current we argue that the existence of a well defined ground state implies the vanishing of all conformal dilaton scattering amplitudes.
84,Some Unique Fixed Point Theorems in Multiplicative Metric Spaces,"Muhammad Sarwar, Badshah-e-Rome","math.GM, 47H10, 54H25, 55M20","\""{O}zavsar and Cevikel(Fixed point of multiplicative contraction mappings on multiplicative metric space.arXiv:1205.5131v1 [math.GN] 23 may 2012)initiated the concept of the multiplicative metric space in such a way that the usual triangular inequality is replaced by ""multiplicative triangle inequality $d(x,y)\leq d(x,z).d(z,y)$ for all $x,y,z\in X$"". In this manuscript, we discussed some unique fixed point theorems in the context of multiplicative metric spaces. The established results carry some well known results from the literature to multiplicative metric space. We note that some fixed point theorems can be deduced in multiplicative metric space by using the established results. Appropriate examples are also given."
85,A note on semi-conjugacy for circle actions,"Michelle Bucher, Roberto Frigerio, Tobias Hartnick","math.GT, math.DG, math.GR","We define a notion of semi-conjugacy between orientation-preserving actions of a group on the circle, which for fixed point free actions coincides with a classical definition of Ghys. We then show that two circle actions are semi-conjugate if and only if they have the same bounded Euler class. This settles some existing confusion present in the literature."
86,An Electronic Compendium of Extreme Functions for the Gomory--Johnson   Infinite Group Problem,"Matthias K√∂ppe, Yuan Zhou","math.OC, cs.DM",In this note we announce the availability of an electronic compendium of extreme functions for Gomory--Johnson's infinite group problem. These functions serve as the strongest cut-generating functions for integer linear optimization problems. We also close several gaps in the literature.
87,Inadequate experimental methods and erroneous epilepsy diagnostic   criteria result in confounding acquired focal epilepsy with genetic absence   epilepsy,"Raimondo D'Ambrosio, Clifford L. Eastman, John W. Miller",q-bio.NC,"Here we provide a thorough discussion of the study conducted by Rodgers et al. (J Neurosci. 2015; 35(24):9194-204. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0919-15.2015) to investigate focal seizures and acquired epileptogenesis induced by head injury in the rat. This manuscript serves as supplementary document for our letter to the Editor to appear in the Journal of Neuroscience. We find that the subject article suffers from poor experimental design, very selective consideration of antecedent literature, and application of inappropriate epilepsy diagnostic criteria which, together, lead to unwarranted conclusions."
88,Three Branches of Dynamo Action,"Emmanuel Dormy, Ludivine Oruba, Ludovic Petitdemange",physics.geo-ph,"In addition to the weak-dipolar state and to the fluctuating-multipolar state, widely discussed in the literature, a third regime has been identified in Dormy (2016). It corresponds to a strong-dipolar branch which appears to approach, in a numerically affordable regime, the magnetostrophic limit relevant to the dynamics of the Earth's core. We discuss the transitions between these states and point to the relevance of this strong-dipolar state to Geodynamo modelling."
89,Remarks on superdifferential equations,"Janusz Grabowski, Javier de Lucas","math-ph, math.CA, math.MP, 34A26 (primary), 58A50, 15A75, 32C38 (secondary)","We show that the term `superdifferential equation' has been employed in the literature to refer to different types of differential equations with even and odd variables. It is justified on physical and mathematical grounds that a subclass of them, the hereafter called Grassmann-valued differential equations, cannot be effectively described through supergeometric techniques. Instead, we analyse them in terms of standard differential equations on Grassmann algebra bundles. Our considerations are illustrated through examples of physical and mathematical relevance."

Budkov","Sahin Buyukdagli, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Ralf Blossey",cond-mat.soft,"The article by Budkov introduces a nonlocal field-theoretic model of solvent-explicit electrostatics. Despite giving a detailed introduction to the early literature on the topic, the article misses out on a series of articles that we published several years ago. Consequently, the manuscript essentially rederives without mention several results that were derived by us for the first time."

The mild assumptions required by our approach make it possible to apply it in a number of contexts of interests, recovering and extending numerous ad hoc globalization constructions from the literature in some cases and providing obstruction for globalization in some other cases."

The study concerns a class of Lagrangians and initial data functions, which are $displacement\ convex$ and so, it may be in dichotomy with the class of so--called $monotone$ functions, widely considered in the literature. We construct solutions to both the scalar and vectorial master equations in potential Mean Field Games, when the underlying space is the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ and so, it is not compact."

Each block of the objective contains a further smooth convex function. We investigate the dynamical system proposed and prove that its trajectories asymptotically converge to a saddle point of the Lagrangian of the convex optimization problem. Time discretization of the dynamical system leads to the alternating minimization algorithm AMA and also to its proximal variant recently introduced in the literature."

These are different from the multi-dimensional Riemann problems widely studied in the literature. Our computations provide numerical evidence of the existence of initial value problems with multiple solutions, thus revealing a fundamental obstruction toward the well-posedness of the governing equations. The compressible Euler equations are solved using the positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method."
95,Reconsideration of feasibility of Hall amplifier,"Abhimanyu Kumar, Om Prakash Pandey","physics.app-ph, cs.SY, eess.SY","In 1955, it was first suggested that Hall effect can be employed for amplification purposes by using semiconductor material with very high mobility. While this idea was limited at that time, yet it was not entirely discarded expecting eventual progress. We revisit this idea and discuss it in the light of current literature. This manuscript kindles this 65 year old amazing idea and views it with modern understanding, which will aid in realizing Hall amplifiers."

Campiglio, C. Fermon, M. Pannetier-Lecoeur",physics.app-ph,"In this manuscript we propose a theoretical model where the magneto-resistive elements are modelled as fluctuating resistances to correct the output voltage noise of tunnel magnetic junction (MTJ) from standard electronic circuits. This model is validated on single elements, partial and full Wheatstone bridge circuits, giving rise to a correction factor affecting the output noise voltage as well as sensitivity values. Combining the correction factor and a normalization by the number of MTJs pillars and the pillar surface, we show that the performances extracted by this method allow universal comparison between any results from literature."
97,Matricial Proofs of Some Classical Results about Critical Point Location,"Charles R. Johnson, Pietro Paparella",math.AG,"The Gauss--Lucas and B\^{o}cher--Grace--Marden theorems are classical results in the geometry of polynomials. Proofs of the these results are available in the literature, but the approaches are seemingly different. In this work, we show that these theorems can be proven in a unified theoretical framework utilizing matrix analysis (in particular, using the field of values and the differentiator of a matrix). In addition, we provide a useful variant of a well-known result due to Siebeck."

This manuscript collects some fragmentary thoughts from various failed and abandoned attempts. This is not a complete work, does not provide a comprehensive overview of the literature, and has no definitive conclusions. It is posted in the hope that some part of it might prove useful to someone at some point in the future. I also take this opportunity to include anotter important result of more general interest (Appendix B)."

Jev{\dj}eni\'c and N. Stopar, we introduce a new definition of zero-divisor graphs attached to rings, that includes all of the classical definitions already known in the literature. We provide an interpretation of such graphs as images of a functor, that we call zero-divisor functor and which is associated with a family of special equivalence relations fixed beforehand. We thus recover and generalize many known results for zero-divisor graphs and provide a framework which might be useful for further investigations on this topic."

It then investigates typical cable faults, including insulation degradation, conductor faults, and ground faults, providing insights into their characteristics, causes, and detection methods. Furthermore, the manuscript surveys the latest publications and standards on DSP techniques in fault location spanning various algorithms used. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of low and medium-voltage cables, fault types, and DSP techniques.

In addition, we present a spectral shrinkage analysis and spectral gap estimates for the linearised 1D dissipative Boltzmann operator with such interactions. Based on this study, we explore the convergence in $H^s$ and $L^{1}$ spaces for the linear and nonlinear models. This study extends classical results found in the literature given for spaces with weak topologies."

It can be divided into four parts: The first part is an introduction to the theory of monomorphism categories, including a short survey on some representation theoretic results. The second part is a summary of some recent results on monomorphism categories based on joint work with Nan Gao, Julian K\""ulshammer and Chrysostomos Psaroudakis. It also includes a new result, namely a classification of all monomorphism categories of finite type over cyclic abelian groups. The third part concerns the relationship between submodule categories and $p$-valuated abelian groups. The last part contains a proof of wildness of a certain monomorphism category, rectifying a statement in the literature."
104,The Berry-Esseen Bound for High-dimensional Self-normalized Sums,"Woonyoung Chang, Kenta Takatsu, Konrad Urban, Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla","math.PR, math.ST, stat.TH","This manuscript studies the Gaussian approximation of the coordinate-wise maximum of self-normalized statistics in high-dimensional settings. We derive an explicit Berry-Esseen bound under weak assumptions on the absolute moments. When the third absolute moment is finite, our bound scales as $\log^{5/4}(d)/n^{1/8}$ where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimension. Hence, our bound tends to zero as long as $\log(d)=o(n^{1/10})$. Our results on self-normalized statistics represent substantial advancements, as such a bound has not been previously available in the high-dimensional central limit theorem (CLT) literature."

However, there are a variety of configurations, parameters and performance criteria of solar assisted ASHP systems, leading to a major inconsistency that increase the degree of complexity to compare and implement different systems. A comparative literature review is lacking, with the aim to evaluate the performance of various ASHP systems from three main solar sources, such as solar thermal (ST), photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T). This paper thus conducts a systematic review of the prevailing solar assisted ASHP systems, including their boundary conditions, system configurations, performance indicators, research methodologies and system performance. The comparison result indicates that PV-ASHP system has the best techno-economic performance, which performs best in average with coefficient of performance (COP) of around 3.75, but with moderate cost and payback time. While ST-ASHP and PV/T-ASHP systems have lower performance with mean COP of 2.90 and 3.03, respectively. Moreover, PV/T-ASHP system has the highest cost and longest payback time, while ST-ASHP has the lowest ones. Future research are discussed from aspects of methodologies, system optimization and standard evaluation."
109,Entropy and Long range correlations in literary English,"Werner Ebeling, Thorsten Poeschel","cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech","We investigated long range correlations in two literary texts, Moby Dick by H. Melville and Grimm's tales. The analysis is based on the calculation of entropy like quantities as the mutual information for pairs of letters and the entropy, the mean uncertainty, per letter. We further estimate the number of different subwords of a given length n. Filtering out the contributions due to the effects of the finite length of the texts, we find correlations ranging to a few hundred letters. Scaling laws for the mutual information (decay with a power law), for the entropy per letter (decay with the inverse square root of n) and for the word numbers (stretched exponential growth with n and with a power law of the text length) were found."
110,Multifractal analysis of sentence lengths in English literary texts,"Iwona Grabska-Gradzi≈Ñska, Andrzej Kulig, Jaros≈Çaw Kwapie≈Ñ, Pawe≈Ç O≈õwiƒôcimka, Stanis≈Çaw Dro≈ºd≈º","physics.data-an, cs.CL, physics.soc-ph","This paper presents analysis of 30 literary texts written in English by different authors. For each text, there were created time series representing length of sentences in words and analyzed its fractal properties using two methods of multifractal analysis: MFDFA and WTMM. Both methods showed that there are texts which can be considered multifractal in this representation but a majority of texts are not multifractal or even not fractal at all. Out of 30 books, only a few have so-correlated lengths of consecutive sentences that the analyzed signals can be interpreted as real multifractals. An interesting direction for future investigations would be identifying what are the specific features which cause certain texts to be multifractal and other to be monofractal or even not fractal at all."
111,"God ($\equiv Elohim$), the first small world network",Marcel Ausloos,"physics.soc-ph, cs.SI","In this paper, the approach of network mapping of words in literary texts is extended to ''textual factors'': the network nodes are defined as ''concepts''; the links are ''community connexions''. Thereafter, the text network properties are investigated along modern statistical physics approaches of networks, thereby relating network topology and algebraic properties, to literary texts contents. As a practical illustration, the first chapter of the Genesis in the Bible is mapped into a 10 node network, as in the Kabbalah approach, mentioning God ($\equiv Elohim$). The characteristics of the network are studied starting from its adjacency matrix, and the corresponding Laplacian matrix. Triplets of nodes are particularly examined in order to emphasize the ''textual (community) connexions'' of each agent ""emanation"", through the so called clustering coefficients and the overlap index, whence measuring the ''semantic flow'' between the different nodes. It is concluded that this graph is a small-world network, weakly dis-assortative, because its average local clustering coefficient is significantly higher than a random graph constructed on the same vertex set."
112,The Colorful Chemical Bottle Experiment Kit: From School Laboratory To   Public Demonstration,"Taweetham Limpanuparb, Suphattra Hsu",physics.chem-ph,"The blue bottle experiment was first introduced to the chemical education literature as a simple demonstration on kinetics. Its original formulation contains only glucose, NaOH and small amount of methylene blue. The solution turns blue when shaken and fades to colorless upon standing. This bluing/de-bluing cycle may be repeated and may be compared to blood colors in animal's respiratory cycle. Inspired by the blue bottle experiment, the colorful chemical bottle experiment kit was commercially developed in 2006. The kit is a versatile pedagogical tool, not only for physical chemistry but also for analytical, biological and organic chemistry. It also helps teaching concepts in scientific method and laboratory safety. This manuscript contains four parts, brief review on literature relating to the blue bottle experiment, description of the colorful chemical bottle experiment kit, pedagogical discussion of the experiments and preliminary evaluation from students."
113,Accuracy of Multiscale Reduction for Stochastic Reaction Systems,"German Enciso, Jinsu Kim","math.PR, q-bio.QM","Stochastic models of chemical reaction networks are an important tool to describe and analyze noise effects in cell biology. When chemical species and reaction rates in a reaction system have different orders of magnitude, the associated stochastic system is often modeled in a multiscale regime. It is known that multiscale models can be approximated with a reduced system such as mean field dynamics or hybrid systems, but the accuracy of the approximation remains unknown. In this paper, we estimate the probability distribution of low copy species in multiscale stochastic reaction systems under short-time scale. We also establish an error bound for this approximation. Throughout the manuscript, typical mass action systems are mainly handled, but we also show that the main theorem can extended to general kinetics, which generalizes existing results in the literature. Our approach is based on a direct analysis of the Kolmogorov equation, in contrast to classical approaches in the existing literature."
114,Detecting a target with quantum entanglement,"Giacomo Sorelli, Nicolas Treps, Frederic Grosshans, Fabrice Boust",quant-ph,"In the last decade a lot of research activity focused on the use of quantum entanglement as a resource for remote target detection, i.e. on the design of a quantum radar. The literature on this subject uses tools of quantum optics and quantum information theory, and therefore it often results obscure to radar engineers. This review has been written with the purpose of removing this obscurity.As such, it contains a review of the main advances in the quantum radar literature accompanied by a thorough introduction of the quantum optics background necessary for its understanding."
115,Use of mathematical modelling to assess respiratory syncytial virus   epidemiology and interventions: A literature review,J. C. Lang,"q-bio.PE, math.DS, 92D30 (Primary), 92C60 (Secondary)","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide, resulting in approximately sixty thousand annual hospitalizations of <5-year-olds in the United States alone and three million annual hospitalizations globally. The development of over 40 vaccines and immunoprophylactic interventions targeting RSV has the potential to significantly reduce the disease burden from RSV infection in the near future. In the context of RSV, a highly contagious pathogen, dynamic transmission models (DTMs) are valuable tools in the evaluation and comparison of the effectiveness of different interventions. This review, the first of its kind for RSV DTMs, provides a valuable foundation for future modelling efforts and highlights important gaps in our understanding of RSV epidemics. Specifically, we have searched the literature using Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PubMed to identify all published manuscripts reporting the development of DTMs focused on the population transmission of RSV. We reviewed the resulting studies and summarized the structure, parameterization, and results of the models developed therein. We anticipate that future RSV DTMs, combined with cost-effectiveness evaluations, will play a significant role in shaping decision making in the development and implementation of intervention programs."
116,A Note on Simulation-Based Inference by Matching Random Features,Cosma Rohilla Shalizi,"stat.ME, nlin.CD, physics.data-an","We can, and should, do statistical inference on simulation models by adjusting the parameters in the simulation so that the values of {\em randomly chosen} functions of the simulation output match the values of those same functions calculated on the data. Results from the ""state-space reconstruction"" or ""geometry from a time series'' literature in nonlinear dynamics indicate that just $2d+1$ such functions will typically suffice to identify a model with a $d$-dimensional parameter space. Results from the ""random features"" literature in machine learning suggest that using random functions of the data can be an efficient replacement for using optimal functions. In this preliminary, proof-of-concept note, I sketch some of the key results, and present numerical evidence about the new method's properties. A separate, forthcoming manuscript will elaborate on theoretical and numerical details."
117,Predicting the formation and stability of oxide perovskites by   extracting underlying mechanisms using machine learning,"George Stephen Thoppil, Alankar Alankar",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"The optimization of properties of perovskite oxides has drawn interest on account of their diverse areas of application. In this work, the hierarchical clustering technique is used to reduce the multi-collinearity among selected features from literature that are reported to have an effect on perovskite formation and stability. Operating on the vast composition space of double oxide perovskite compositions available in literature and online repositories, in this manuscript, an attempt has been made to extract the relationship between the composition and structure to predict their formability and stability. Machine learning (ML) classifiers are trained on these datasets to predict novel stable perovskite compositions. The study uses a vast feature space to narrow down the most important factors affecting the formability and stability in perovskite compounds. It also identifies stable compositions that have band gaps suitable for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. The developed random forest (RF)-based models may be extended to include the implications beyond photosensitive applications by focusing on the physico-chemical mechanisms driving the phenomena behind each application."
118,Probabilistic forecasting of German electricity imbalance prices,Micha≈Ç Narajewski,"q-fin.ST, econ.EM, stat.ML","The exponential growth of renewable energy capacity has brought much uncertainty to electricity prices and to electricity generation. To address this challenge, the energy exchanges have been developing further trading possibilities, especially the intraday and balancing markets. For an energy trader participating in both markets, the forecasting of imbalance prices is of particular interest. Therefore, in this manuscript we conduct a very short-term probabilistic forecasting of imbalance prices, contributing to the scarce literature in this novel subject. The forecasting is performed 30 minutes before the delivery, so that the trader might still choose the trading place. The distribution of the imbalance prices is modelled and forecasted using methods well-known in the electricity price forecasting literature: lasso with bootstrap, gamlss, and probabilistic neural networks. The methods are compared with a naive benchmark in a meaningful rolling window study. The results provide evidence of the efficiency between the intraday and balancing markets as the sophisticated methods do not substantially overperform the intraday continuous price index. On the other hand, they significantly improve the empirical coverage. The analysis was conducted on the German market, however it could be easily applied to any other market of similar structure."
119,Probabilistic models and statistics for electronic financial markets in   the digital age,Markus Bibinger,"q-fin.ST, math.ST, stat.TH, Primary 62M10, Secondary 60J65, 60F05","The scope of this manuscript is to review some recent developments in statistics for discretely observed semimartingales which are motivated by applications for financial markets. Our journey through this area stops to take closer looks at a few selected topics discussing recent literature. We moreover highlight and explain the important role played by some classical concepts of probability and statistics. We focus on three main aspects: Testing for jumps; rough fractional stochastic volatility; and limit order microstructure noise. We review jump tests based on extreme value theory and complement the literature proposing new statistical methods. They are based on asymptotic theory of order statistics and the R\'{e}nyi representation. The second stage of our journey visits a recent strand of research showing that volatility is rough. We further investigate this and establish a minimax lower bound exploring frontiers to what extent the regularity of latent volatility can be recovered in a more general framework. Finally, we discuss a stochastic boundary model with one-sided microstructure noise for high-frequency limit order prices and its probabilistic and statistical foundation."
120,Review on thermoelectric properties of transition metal dichalcogenides,"I. Pallecchi, N. Manca, B. Patil, L. Pellegrino, D. Marre'","cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.mes-hall","Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered an advantageous alternative to their celebrated two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals akin compound, graphene, for a number of applications, especially those requiring a gapped and possibly tunable band structure. Thermoelectricity is one of the application fields where TMDs could indeed outperform graphene, thanks to their lower thermal conductivity, large effective masses, valley degeneracy, varied and tunable transport properties, as well as sensitivity of their band structures and phonon spectra to confinement. Yet, despite promising theoretical predictions, thermoelectric properties of TMDs have not been extensively investigated so far and a clear assessment of TMDs as viable thermoelectric materials, based on experimental results, is still missing. In this paper, we review the experimental findings of literature on thermoelectric properties of TMDs, to sort out the countless combinations of chemical compositions, doping, off-stoichiometry and sample forms which could potentially result in optimized and possibly competitive thermoelectric properties. Based on the experimental data of literature, we simulate the performance of an all-TMD thermoelectric device for practical application as a micron sized cryocooler or power generator."
121,Towards an automated workflow in materials science for combining   multi-modal simulative and experimental information using data mining and   large language models,"Balduin Katzer, Steffen Klinder, Katrin Schulz","cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG","To retrieve and compare scientific data of simulations and experiments in materials science, data needs to be easily accessible and machine readable to qualify and quantify various materials science phenomena. The recent progress in open science leverages the accessibility to data. However, a majority of information is encoded within scientific documents limiting the capability of finding suitable literature as well as material properties. This manuscript showcases an automated workflow, which unravels the encoded information from scientific literature to a machine readable data structure of texts, figures, tables, equations and meta-data, using natural language processing and language as well as vision transformer models to generate a machine-readable database. The machine-readable database can be enriched with local data, as e.g. unpublished or private material data, leading to knowledge synthesis. The study shows that such an automated workflow accelerates information retrieval, proximate context detection and material property extraction from multi-modal input data exemplarily shown for the research field of microstructural analyses of face-centered cubic single crystals. Ultimately, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Model (LLM) enables a fast and efficient question answering chat bot."
122,Node similarity as a basic principle behind connectivity in complex   networks,Matthias Scholz,"physics.soc-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.SI","How are people linked in a highly connected society? Since in many networks a power-law (scale-free) node-degree distribution can be observed, power-law might be seen as a universal characteristics of networks. But this study of communication in the Flickr social online network reveals that power-law node-degree distributions are restricted to only sparsely connected networks. More densely connected networks, by contrast, show an increasing divergence from power-law. This work shows that this observation is consistent with the classic idea from social sciences that similarity is the driving factor behind communication in social networks. The strong relation between communication strength and node similarity could be confirmed by analyzing the Flickr network. It also is shown that node similarity as a network formation model can reproduce the characteristics of different network densities and hence can be used as a model for describing the topological transition from weakly to strongly connected societies."

Correia, Mitsuru S√¥ma","astro-ph.SR, physics.geo-ph, physics.space-ph","The importance of the investigation of magnetic superstorms is not limited to academic interest, because these superstorms can cause catastrophic impact on the modern civilisation due to our increasing dependency on technological infrastructure. In this context, the Carrington storm in September 1859 is considered as a benchmark of observational history owing to its magnetic disturbance and equatorial extent of the auroral oval. So far, several recent auroral reports at that time have been published but those reports are mainly derived from the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, we analyse datable auroral reports from South America and its vicinity, assess the auroral extent using philological and astrometric approaches, identify the auroral visibility at - 17.3{\deg} magnetic latitude and further poleward and reconstruct the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval to be 25.1{\deg} +/- 0.5{\deg} in invariant latitude. Interestingly, brighter and more colourful auroral displays were reported in the South American sector than in the Northern Hemisphere. This north-south asymmetry is presumably associated with variations of their magnetic longitude and the weaker magnetic field over South America compared to the magnetic conjugate point and the increased amount of magnetospheric electron precipitation into the upper atmosphere. These results attest that the magnitude of the Carrington storm indicates that its extent falls within the range of other superstorms, such as those that occurred in May 1921 and February 1872, in terms of the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval."
124,Effective sound speed in relativistic accretion discs around rotating   black holes,"Susovan Maity, Md Arif Shaikh, Tapas Kumar Das","astro-ph.HE, gr-qc","For axially symmetric accretion maintained in the hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical direction in the Kerr metric, the radial Mach number does not become unity at the critical point. The sonic points are, thus, formed at a radial distance different from that where the critical points are formed. We propose that a modified dynamical sound speed can be defined through the linear perturbation of the full space-time dependent equations describing the aforementioned accretion flow structure. The linear stability analysis of such fluid equations leads to the formation of an wave equation which describes the propagation of linear acoustic perturbation. The speed of propagation of such perturbation can be used as the effective sound speed which makes the value of the Mach number to be unity when evaluated at the critical points. This allows the critical points to coalesce with the sonic points. We study how the spin angular momentum of the black hole (the Kerr parameter) influences the value of the effective sound speed."

The philosophy is based on the recent findings on convex quadratic equation (CQE), which help clarify a geometric interpretation that relates CQE to convex quadratic function (CQF). More specifically, regarding the solvability of CQE, its necessary and sufficient condition as well as a unified parameterization of all the solutions has recently been analytically formulated. Moving forward, the understanding of CQE is utilized to describe the geometric structure of CQF, and the CQE-CQF relation. All these results are shown closely related to a basis in the optimization literature, namely quadratic programming (QP). For the first time from this viewpoint, the QPs subject to equality, inequality, equality-and-inequality, and extended constraints can be algebraically solved in derivative-free closed formulae, respectively. All the results are derived without knowing a feasible point, a priori and any time during the process."

Bayrak",quant-ph,"In this manuscript, we investigate the exact bound state solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for an energy-dependent Coulomb-like vector plus scalar potential energies. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is examined in literature with a constant and position dependent mass functions. As a novelty, we assume a mass-function that depends on energy and position and revisit the problem with the following cases: First, we examine the case where the mixed vector and scalar potential energy possess equal magnitude and equal sign as well as an opposite sign. Then, we study pure scalar and pure vector cases. In each case, we derive an analytic expression of the energy spectrum by employing the asymptotic iteration method. We obtain a non-trivial relation among the tuning parameters which lead the examined problem to a constant mass one. Finally, we calculate the energy spectrum by the Secant method and show that the corresponding unnormalized wave functions satisfy the boundary conditions. We conclude the manuscript with a comparison of the calculated energy spectra versus tuning parameters."
127,On the minimum value of the Colless index and the bifurcating trees that   achieve it,"Tom√°s M. Coronado, Mareike Fischer, Lina Herbst, Francesc Rossell√≥, Kristina Wicke","q-bio.PE, cs.DM, math.CO","Measures of tree balance play an important role in the analysis of phylogenetic trees. One of the oldest and most popular indices in this regard is the Colless index for rooted bifurcating trees, introduced by Colless (1982). While many of its statistical properties under different probabilistic models for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known about its minimum value and the trees that achieve it. In this manuscript, we fill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and closed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with $n$ leaves. Surprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless index and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve. We then fully characterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce both an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them. After focusing on two extremal classes of trees with minimum Colless index (the maximally balanced trees and the greedy from the bottom trees), we conclude by showing that all trees with minimum Colless index also have minimum Sackin index, another popular balance index."

The aim of this manuscript is to study the foundations and generalizations of this notion. We show that correct test sequences are almost omnipresent and appear in many different forms in the mathematical literature: As identity sequences for Function Identity Test, as norming sets in the field of Banach algebras or as samples in the context of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. As main outcome, we generalize the main statement of Heintz-Schnorr (1982) proving that short correct test sequences for constructible sets of lists of polynomials do exist and are densely distributed in any constructible set of accurate dimension and degree. The main tool used to prove this result is the theory of degree of constructible sets, which we introduce and develop in this manuscript, generalizing the results of Heintz (1983) and proving two Bezout's Inequalities for two different notions of degree. We present a ${\bf BPP}_K$ algorithm to exhibit the power of correct test sequences, this algorithm decides whether a list of polynomials is a secant sequence by just evaluating the input list at some well-suited points. We show the differences between correct test sequences and Demillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel probabilistic tests and we reformulate, prove and generalize two well-known results of the Polynomial Method: We prove Dvir's exponential lower bounds for Kakeya sets from lower bounds for the length of correct test sequences and generalize Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz."
129,A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods   and supertree methods,"Mareike Fischer, Michael Hendriksen","q-bio.PE, math.CO, C92B05, 05C05","In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.   \textbf{Keywords:} consensus tree, phylogenetics, majority rule, tree refinement, matrix representation with parsimony   \textbf{MSC:} C92B05, 05C05"
130,Measuring tree balance using symmetry nodes -- a new balance index and   its extremal properties,"Sophie J. Kersting, Mareike Fischer","q-bio.PE, math.CO","Effects like selection in evolution as well as fertility inheritance in the development of populations can lead to a higher degree of asymmetry in evolutionary trees than expected under a null hypothesis. To identify and quantify such influences, various balance indices were proposed in the phylogenetic literature and have been in use for decades.   However, so far no balance index was based on the number of \emph{symmetry nodes}, even though symmetry nodes play an important role in other areas of mathematical phylogenetics and despite the fact that symmetry nodes are a quite natural way to measure balance or symmetry of a given tree.   The aim of this manuscript is thus twofold: First, we will introduce the \emph{symmetry nodes index} as an index for measuring balance of phylogenetic trees and analyze its extremal properties. We also show that this index can be calculated in linear time. This new index turns out to be a generalization of a simple and well-known balance index, namely the \emph{cherry index}, as well as a specialization of another, less established, balance index, namely \emph{Rogers' $J$ index}. Thus, it is the second objective of the present manuscript to compare the new symmetry nodes index to these two indices and to underline its advantages. In order to do so, we will derive some extremal properties of the cherry index and Rogers' $J$ index along the way and thus complement existing studies on these indices. Moreover, we used the programming language \textsf{R} to implement all three indices in the software package \textsf{symmeTree}, which has been made publicly available."
131,Progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the   Lawson criterion,"Samuel E. Wurzel, Scott C. Hsu","physics.plasm-ph, physics.soc-ph","The Lawson criterion is a key concept in the pursuit of fusion energy, relating the fuel density $n$, pulse duration $\tau$ or energy confinement time $\tau_E$, and fuel temperature $T$ to the energy gain $Q$ of a fusion plasma. The purpose of this paper is to explain and review the Lawson criterion and to provide a compilation of achieved parameters for a broad range of historical and contemporary fusion experiments. Although this paper focuses on the Lawson criterion, it is only one of many equally important factors in assessing the progress and ultimate likelihood of any fusion concept becoming a commercially viable fusion-energy system. Only experimentally measured or inferred values of $n$, $\tau$ or $\tau_E$, and $T$ that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature are included in this paper, unless noted otherwise. For extracting these parameters, we discuss methodologies that are necessarily specific to different fusion approaches (including magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion). This paper is intended to serve as a reference for fusion researchers and a tutorial for all others interested in fusion energy."
132,Bundle Theoretic Descriptions of Massive Single-Particle State Spaces;   With a view toward Relativistic Quantum Information Theory,Heon Lee,"math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph, 81P99, 81Q99, 83A99","Relativistic Quantum Information Theory (RQI) is a flourishing research area of physics, yet, there has been no systematic mathematical treatment of the field. In this paper, we suggest bundle theoretic descriptions of massive single-particle state spaces, which are basic building blocks of RQI. In the language of bundle theory, one can construct a vector bundle over the set of all possible motion states of a massive particle, in whose fibers the moving particle's internal quantum state as perceived by a fixed inertial observer is encoded. A link between the usual Hilbert space description is provided by a generalized induced representation construction on the $L^2$-section space of the bundle. The aim of this paper is two-fold. One is to communicate the basic ideas of RQI to mathematicians and the other is to suggest an improved formalism for single-particle state spaces that encompasses all known massive particles including those which have never been dealt with in the RQI literature. Some of the theoretical implications of the formalism will be explored at the end of the paper."

In this manuscript, I give a wide review of interstellar dust properties and some of the modern techniques used to study it. I start with a general introduction presenting the main concepts, in molecular and solid-state physics, required to understand the contemporary literature on the subject. I then review the empirical evidence we currently use to constrain state-of-the-art dust models. Follows a long discussion about our current understanding of the grain properties of nearby galaxies, with an emphasis on the results from spectral energy distribution modeling. The following chapter presents dust evolution at all scales. I review the different microphysical evolution processes, and the way they are accounted for in cosmic dust evolution models. I give my take on the origin of interstellar dust in galaxies of different metallicities. The last chapter focusses on methodology. I give an introduction to the Bayesian method and compare it to frequentist techniques. I discuss the epistemological consequences of the two approaches, and show why the field of interstellar dust requires a probabilistic viewpoint. I end the manuscript with a summary of the major breakthroughs achieved in the past decade, and delineate a few prospectives for the next decade."

In the present work, the thermal neutron self-shielding factors of indium, gold, zinc, and mercury were determined experimentally. The current results together with those found in the literature were used to validate a mathematical ab initio formulae based on integral cross-section parameters used to compare our results. The complete agreement among these species of data suggests the validity of correlating the neutron migration length in the convex-shaped material with the average chord length described in the mathematical model."
135,De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for kinetic equations with nonlocal   diffusions,"Francesca Anceschi, Giampiero Palatucci, Mirco Piccinini",math.AP,"We extend the celebrated De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory to a class of nonlocal hypoelliptic equations naturally arising in kinetic theory, which combine a first-order operator with an elliptic one involving fractional derivatives along only part of the coordinates. Provided that the nonlocal tail in velocity of weak solutions is just $p$-summable along the drift variables, we prove the first local $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimate for kinetic integral equations. Then, we establish the first strong Harnack inequality under the aforementioned tail summability assumption. The latter is in fact naturally implied in literature, e. g., from the usual mass density boundedness (as for the Boltzmann equation without cut-off), and it reveals to be in clear accordance with the very recent counterexample by Kassmann and Weidner \cite{KW24c}. Armed with the aforementioned results, we are able to provide a geometric characterization of the Harnack inequality in the same spirit of the seminal paper by Aronson and Serrin \cite{AS67} for the (local) parabolic counterpart."
136,$U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking quark interactions from vacuum polarization,Fabio L. Braghin,"hep-ph, hep-th, nucl-th","By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results."
137,"The roles of adhesion, internal heat generation and elevated   temperatures in normally loaded, sliding rough surfaces","Benjamin Poole, Bartosz Barzdajn, Daniele Dini, David Stewart, Fionn Dunne",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"The thermal effects of plastic and frictional heat generation and elevated temperature were examined along with the role of adhesion in the context of galling wear, using a representative crystal plasticity, normally loaded, sliding surface model. Galling frequency behaviour was predicted for 316L steel. Deformation of the surfaces was dominated by the surface geometry, with no significant effect due to variations in frictional models. Plastic and frictional heating were found to have a minimal effect on the deformation of the surface, with the rapid conduction of heat preventing any highly localised heating. There was no corresponding effect on the predicted galling frequency response.   Isothermal, elevated temperature conditions caused a decrease in galling resistance, driven by the temperature sensitivity of the critical resolved shear stress. The extent of deformation, as quantified by the area of plastically deformed material and plastic reach, increased with temperature. Comparisons were made with literature results for several surface amplitude and wavelength conditions. Model results compared favourably with those in the literature. However, the reduction in predicted galling resistance with elevated temperature for a fixed surface was not as severe as observations in the literature, suggesting other mechanisms (e.g. phase transformations, surface coatings and oxides) are likely important."
138,The relative orientation between local magnetic field and Galactic plane   in low latitude dark clouds,"Gulafsha B. Choudhury, Himadri S. Das, B. J. Medhi, J. C. Pandey, S. Wolf, T. K. Dhar, A. M. Mazarbhuiya",astro-ph.GA,"In this work, we study the magnetic field morphology of selected star-forming clouds spread over the galactic latitude ($b$) range, $-10^\circ$ to $10^\circ$. The polarimetric observation of clouds CB24, CB27 and CB188 are conducted to study the magnetic field geometry of those clouds from ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital, India. These observations are combined with those of 14 further low latitude clouds available in the literature. Analyzing the polarimetric data of 17 clouds, we find that the alignment between the envelope magnetic field ($\theta_{B}^{env}$) and Galactic plane ($\theta_{GP}$) of the low-latitude clouds varies with their galactic longitudes ($l$). We observe a strong correlation between the longitude (\textit{l}) and the offset ($\theta_{off}=|\theta_B^{env}-\theta_{GP}|$) which shows that $\theta_{B}^{env}$ is parallel to the Galactic plane (GP) when the clouds are situated in the region, $115^\circ<l<250^\circ$. However, $\theta_{B}^{env}$ has its own local deflection irrespective of the orientation of $\theta_{GP}$ when the clouds are at $l<100^\circ$ and $l>250^\circ$. To check the consistency of our results, the stellar polarization data available at Heiles (2000) catalogue are overlaid on DSS image of the clouds having mean polarization vector of field stars. The results are almost consistent with the Heiles data. The effect of turbulence of the cloud is also studied which may play an important role in causing the misalignment phenomenon observed between $\theta_{B}^{env}$ and $\theta_{GP}$. We have used \textit{Herschel} \textit{SPIRE} 500 $\mu m$ and \textit{SCUBA} 850 $\mu m$ dust continuum emission maps in our work to understand the density structure of the clouds."
139,Computationally Efficient and Statistically Optimal Robust   High-Dimensional Linear Regression,"Yinan Shen, Jingyang Li, Jian-Feng Cai, Dong Xia","math.ST, cs.IT, math.IT, stat.ME, stat.ML, stat.TH","High-dimensional linear regression under heavy-tailed noise or outlier corruption is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially since the robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a projected sub-gradient descent algorithm for both the sparse linear regression and low-rank linear regression problems. The algorithm is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed with a finite 1 + epsilon moment. The convergence theory is established for a general framework and its specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a surprising phenomenon of two-phase convergence. In phase one, the algorithm behaves as in typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal estimator, which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly, during phase two, the algorithm converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function, and thus a constant stepsize suffices. Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of our algorithm over prior methods."
140,Literary and Colloquial Tamil Dialect Identification,"M. Nanmalar, P. Vijayalakshmi, T. Nagarajan","eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.LG, cs.SD","Culture and language evolve together. The old literary form of Tamil is used commonly for writing and the contemporary colloquial Tamil is used for speaking. Human-computer interaction applications require Colloquial Tamil (CT) to make it more accessible and easy for the everyday user and, it requires Literary Tamil (LT) when information is needed in a formal written format. Continuing the use of LT alongside CT in computer aided language learning applications will both preserve LT, and provide ease of use via CT, at the same time. Hence there is a need for the conversion between LT and CT dialects, which demands as a first step, dialect identification. Dialect Identification (DID) of LT and CT is an unexplored area of research. In the current work, keeping the nuances of both these dialects in mind, five methods are explored which include two implicit methods - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); two explicit methods - Parallel Phone Recognition (PPR) and Parallel Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (P-LVCSR); two versions of the proposed explicit Unified Phone Recognition method (UPR-1 and UPR-2). These methods vary based on: the need for annotated data, the size of the unit, the way in which modelling is carried out, and the way in which the final decision is made. Even though the average duration of the test utterances is less - 4.9s for LT and 2.5s for CT - the systems performed well, offering the following identification accuracies: 87.72% (GMM), 93.97% (CNN), 89.24% (PPR), 94.21% (P-LVCSR), 88.57% (UPR-1), 93.53% (UPR-1 with P-LVCSR), 94.55% (UPR-2), and 95.61% (UPR-2 with P-LVCSR)."
141,A Feature Engineering Approach for Literary and Colloquial Tamil Speech   Classification using 1D-CNN,"M. Nanmalar, S. Johanan Joysingh, P. Vijayalakshmi, T. Nagarajan","eess.AS, cs.LG, cs.SD","In ideal human computer interaction (HCI), the colloquial form of a language would be preferred by most users, since it is the form used in their day-to-day conversations. However, there is also an undeniable necessity to preserve the formal literary form. By embracing the new and preserving the old, both service to the common man (practicality) and service to the language itself (conservation) can be rendered. Hence, it is ideal for computers to have the ability to accept, process, and converse in both forms of the language, as required. To address this, it is first necessary to identify the form of the input speech, which in the current work is between literary and colloquial Tamil speech. Such a front-end system must consist of a simple, effective, and lightweight classifier that is trained on a few effective features that are capable of capturing the underlying patterns of the speech signal. To accomplish this, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) that learns the envelope of features across time, is proposed. The network is trained on a select number of handcrafted features initially, and then on Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) for comparison. The handcrafted features were selected to address various aspects of speech such as the spectral and temporal characteristics, prosody, and voice quality. The features are initially analyzed by considering ten parallel utterances and observing the trend of each feature with respect to time. The proposed 1D-CNN, trained using the handcrafted features, offers an F1 score of 0.9803, while that trained on the MFCC offers an F1 score of 0.9895. In light of this, feature ablation and feature combination are explored. When the best ranked handcrafted features, from the feature ablation study, are combined with the MFCC, they offer the best results with an F1 score of 0.9946."

143,Implications of anomalous gauge boson interactions to the fermion   electromagnetic moments,"Luis Bento, Rui Neves",hep-ph,We calculate the electromagnetic fermion form-factors induced by the anomalous gauge boson interactions contained in the operators ODW and ODB. Other results regarding anomalous triple gauge boson interactions are briefly overviewed. We study the interplay between vertex corrections and gauge boson self-energies extended to the longitudinal degrees of freedom. The physical couplings to an external electromagnetic field are then derived.

145,Alberti's letter counts,Bernard Ycart,"math.HO, cs.CL","Four centuries before modern statistical linguistics was born, Leon Battista Alberti (1404--1472) compared the frequency of vowels in Latin poems and orations, making the first quantified observation of a stylistic difference ever. Using a corpus of 20 Latin texts (over 5 million letters), Alberti's observations are statistically assessed. Letter counts prove that poets used significantly more a's, e's, and y's, whereas orators used more of the other vowels. The sample sizes needed to justify the assertions are studied, and proved to be within reach for Alberti's scholarship."

147,LOOL: Mathematica package for evaluating leading order one loop   functions,"Amon Ilakovac, Luka Popov",hep-ph,One-loop functions with loop masses larger than external masses and momenta can always be expanded in terms of external masses and momenta. The precision requested for observables determines the number of the expansion terms retained in the evaluation. The evaluation of these expansion terms turns out to be much simpler than the exact evaluation of the corresponding one-loop function. Here we present the program which evaluates those expansion terms.   This Mathematica package provides two subroutines. First one performs analytical evaluation of basic one loop integrals. The second one is used to construct composite functions out of those integrals. Composite functions thus obtained are ready for numerical evaluation with literary no time consumption.
148,Liquid money or hard cash? Drowning into granular material,Franco Bagnoli,physics.pop-ph,"In British English, the term ""hard cash"" refers to the form of payment using coins or bill, rather than cheques or credit or money transfer. In American English, it is often prefixed by the adjective ""cold"". On the contrary, in Italian the equivalent expression ""denaro liquido"" can be literary translated as ""liquid money"". In French the expression is equivalent with the additional factor, with respect to the rest of this discussion, that money becomes ""argent"". We have therefore two very different points of view: Is money hard and cold, or rather liquid and ""jingling"" (""moneta sonante"")? As usual, we shall investigate this topic starting from some comics about the duck family."

This study addresses these concerns by asking how SF media reflects scientific findings in exoplanet science. A database of SF exoplanets was analysed using a Bayesian network to find interconnected interactions between planetary characterisation features and literary data. Results reveal SF exoplanets designed after the discovery of real exoplanets are less Earth-like, providing statistical evidence that SF incorporates rapidly-evolving science. Understanding SF's portrayal of science is crucial for its potential use in science communication."

There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality."
153,Literary and Colloquial Dialect Identification for Tamil using Acoustic   Features,"M. Nanmalar, P. Vijayalakshmi, T. Nagarajan","eess.AS, cs.LG","The evolution and diversity of a language is evident from it's various dialects. If the various dialects are not addressed in technological advancements like automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis, there is a chance that these dialects may disappear. Speech technology plays a role in preserving various dialects of a language from going extinct. In order to build a full fledged automatic speech recognition system that addresses various dialects, an Automatic Dialect Identification (ADI) system acting as the front end is required. This is similar to how language identification systems act as front ends to automatic speech recognition systems that handle multiple languages. The current work proposes a way to identify two popular and broadly classified Tamil dialects, namely literary and colloquial Tamil. Acoustical characteristics rather than phonetics and phonotactics are used, alleviating the requirement of language-dependant linguistic tools. Hence one major advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require an annotated corpus, hence it can be easily adapted to other languages. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features are used to perform the classification task. The experiments yielded an error rate of 12%. Vowel nasalization, as being the reason for this good performance, is discussed. The number of mixture models for the GMM is varied and the performance is analysed."
154,Bed load proppant transport during slickwater hydraulic fracturing:   insights from comparisons between published laboratory data and correlations   for sediment and pipeline slurry transport,Mark W. McClure,physics.geo-ph,"Bed load transport is the movement of particles along the top of a bed through rolling, saltation, and suspension created by turbulent lift above the bed surface. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the idea that bed load transport is significant for proppant transport during hydraulic fracturing. However, scaling arguments suggest that bed load transport is only dominant in the laboratory and is negligible at the field scale. I review laboratory experiments that have been used to develop concepts of bed load transport in hydraulic fracturing. I also review the scaling arguments and laboratory results that have been used to argue that viscous drag, not bed load transport, is dominant at the field scale. I compare literature correlations for fluvial sediment transport and for pipeline slurry transport with published laboratory data on proppant transport in slot flow. The comparisons indicate that fluvial transport correlations are suitable for predicting the rate of sediment erosion due to flow of proppant-free fluid over a bed. The pipeline slurry correlations are suitable for predicting the ability of proppant that is already in suspension to flow in bed transport without settling, but only if the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot is close to unity. This can occur at the laboratory scale, but not in the field. The comparison indicates that at low rates of proppant flow, the equilibrium bed height in a laboratory proppant transport experiment can be predicted from pipeline slurry correlations. However, as the volumetric flow rate and the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of the pipeline slurry correlations breaks down. Laboratory experiments using higher volumetric flow rate indicate that bed load transport rates are too low to be significant at the field scale, even if the flow velocity is very high."
155,Do meteoritic silicon carbide grains originate from asymptotic giant   branch stars of super-solar metallicity?,"M. Lugaro, A. I. Karakas, M. Pet√∂, E. Plachy",astro-ph.SR,"We compare literature data for the isotopic ratios of Zr, Sr, and Ba from analysis of single meteoritic stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains to new predictions for the slow neutron-capture process (the s process) in metal-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The models have initial metallicities Z = 0.014 (solar) and Z = 0.03 (twice-solar) and initial masses 2 - 4.5 Msun, selected such as the condition C/O>1 for the formation of SiC is achieved. Because of the higher Fe abundance, the twice-solar metallicity models result in a lower number of total free neutrons released by the 13C({\alpha},n)16O neutron source. Furthermore, the highest-mass (4 - 4.5 Msun) AGB stars of twice-solar metallicity present a milder activation of the 22Ne({\alpha},n)25Mg neutron source than their solar metallicity counterparts, due to cooler temperatures resulting from the effect of higher opacities. They also have a lower amount of the 13C neutron source than the lower-mass models, following their smaller He-rich region. The combination of these different effects allows our AGB models of twice-solar metallicity to provide a match to the SiC data without the need to consider large variations in the features of the 13C neutron source nor neutron-capture processes different from the s process. This raises the question if the AGB parent stars of meteoritic SiC grains were in fact on average of twice-solar metallicity. The heavier-than-solar Si and Ti isotopic ratios in the same grains are in qualitative agreement with an origin in stars of super-solar metallicity because of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Further, the SiC dust mass ejected from C-rich AGB stars is predicted to significantly increase with increasing the metallicity."
156,Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Cross-linked Graphene-Epoxy   Nanocomposites,"R. Rahman, A. Haque","cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.comp-ph","This paper focuses on molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of graphene reinforced cross-linked epoxy (Gr-Ep) nanocomposite. The goal is to study the influence of geometry, and concentration of reinforcing nanographene sheet (NGS) on interfacial properties and elastic constants such as bulk Young's modulus, and shear modulus of Gr-Ep nanocomposites. The most typical cross-linked configuration was obtained in order to use in further simulations. The mechanical properties of this cross-linked structure were determined using MD simulations and the results were verified with those available in literatures. Graphene with different aspect ratios and concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%) were considered in order to construct amorphous unit cells of Gr-Ep nanocomposites. The Gr-Ep nanocomposites system undergoes NVT (constant number of atoms, volume and temperature) and NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure and temperature) ensemble with applied uniform strain field during MD simulation to obtain bulk Young's modulus and shear modulus. The stress-strain response was also evaluated for both amorphous and crystalline unit cells of Gr-Ep system under uni-axial deformation. The cohesive and pullout force vs. displacement response were determined for graphenes with different size. Hence as primary goal of this work, a parametric study using MD simulation was conducted for characterizing interfacial properties and elastic constants with different NGS aspect rations and volume fractions. The MD simulation results show reasonable agreement with available published data in the literature."

Neff, Chris Koen, Charles A. Kuehn, Ian Newsome, Quinlin Riggs",astro-ph.SR,"The literature on the $\lambda$ Boo stars has grown to become somewhat heterogenous, as different authors have applied different criteria across the UV, optical and infrared regions to determine the membership status of $\lambda$ Boo candidates. We aim to clear up the confusion by consulting the literature on 212 objects that have been considered as $\lambda$ Boo candidates, and subsequently evaluating the evidence in favour of their admission to the $\lambda$ Boo class. We obtained new spectra of $\sim$90 of these candidates and classified them on the MK system to aid in the membership evaluations. The re-evaluation of the 212 objects resulted in 64 members and 103 non-members of the $\lambda$ Boo class, with a further 45 stars for which membership status is unclear. We suggest observations for each of the stars in the latter category that will allow them to be confidently included or rejected from the class. Our reclassification facilitates homogenous analysis on group members, and represents the largest collection of confirmed $\lambda$ Boo stars known."

Andersson","physics.flu-dyn, physics.comp-ph","An overset grid method was used to investigate the interaction between a particle-laden flow and a circular cylinder. The overset grid method was implemented in the Pencil Code , a high-order finite-difference code for compressible flow simulation. High-order summation-by-part operators were used at the cylinder boundary, and both bi-linear Lagrangian and bi-quadratic spline interpolation was used to communicate between the background grid and the body-conformal cylindrical grid. The performance of the overset grid method was assessed to benchmark cases of steady and unsteady flows past a cylinder. For steady flow at low Reynolds number, high-order accuracy was achieved for velocity components. Results for flow in the vortex shedding regime showed good agreement to the literature. The method was also applied to particle-laden flow simulations, where spherical point particles were inserted upstream of the cylinder. These inertial particles were convected towards and (possibly) past the cylinder. The simulations reproduced data from the literature at a significantly reduced cost, revealing that the previously published DNS data is less accurate than assumed for particles with very small Stokes numbers."

While the current literature has not yet invoked the rapid advancement in the natural language processing, we construct in this research a textual-based sentiment index using a well-known pre-trained model BERT developed by Google, especially for three actively trading individual stocks in Hong Kong market with at the same time the hot discussion on Weibo.com. On the one hand, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of applying BERT in financial sentiment analysis when compared with the existing models. On the other hand, by combining with the other two commonly-used methods when it comes to building the sentiment index in the financial literature, i.e., the option-implied and the market-implied approaches, we propose a more general and comprehensive framework for the financial sentiment analysis, and further provide convincing outcomes for the predictability of individual stock return by combining LSTM (with a feature of a nonlinear mapping). It is significantly distinct with the dominating econometric methods in sentiment influence analysis which are all of a nature of linear regression."
160,Critic-Only Integral Reinforcement Learning Driven by Variable Gain   Gradient Descent for Optimal Tracking Control,"Amardeep Mishra, Satadal Ghosh","eess.SY, cs.SY","Integral reinforcement learning (IRL) was proposed in literature to obviate the requirement of drift dynamics in adaptive dynamic programming framework. Most of the online IRL schemes in literature require two sets of neural network (NNs), known as actor-critic NN and an initial stabilizing controller. Recently, for RL-based robust tracking this requirement of initial stabilizing controller and dual-approximator structure could be obviated by using a modified gradient descent-based update law containing a stabilizing term with critic-only structure. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no study on leveraging such stabilizing term in IRL algorithm framework to solve optimal trajectory tracking problems for continuous time nonlinear systems with actuator constraints. To this end a novel update law leveraging the stabilizing term along with variable gain gradient descent in IRL framework is presented in this paper. With these modifications, the IRL tracking controller can be implemented using only critic NN, while no initial stabilizing controller is required. Another salient feature of the presented update law is its variable learning rate, which scales the pace of learning based on instantaneous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman error and rate of variation of Lyapunov function along the system trajectories. The augmented system states and NN weight errors are shown to possess uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) stability under the presented update law and achieve a tighter residual set. This update law is validated on a full 6-DoF nonlinear model of UAV for attitude control."
161,Fools Rush In: Competitive Effects of Reaction Time in Automated Trading,"Henry Hanifan, John Cartlidge","q-fin.TR, cs.CE, cs.MA","We explore the competitive effects of reaction time of automated trading strategies in simulated financial markets containing a single exchange with public limit order book and continuous double auction matching. A large body of research conducted over several decades has been devoted to trading agent design and simulation, but the majority of this work focuses on pricing strategy and does not consider the time taken for these strategies to compute. In real-world financial markets, speed is known to heavily influence the design of automated trading algorithms, with the generally accepted wisdom that faster is better. Here, we introduce increasingly realistic models of trading speed and profile the computation times of a suite of eminent trading algorithms from the literature. Results demonstrate that: (a) trading performance is impacted by speed, but faster is not always better; (b) the Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) algorithm, until recently considered the most dominant trading strategy in the literature, is outperformed by the simplistic Shaver (SHVR) strategy - shave one tick off the current best bid or ask - when relative computation times are accurately simulated."
162,From Fractional Quantum Mechanics to Quantum Cosmology: An Overture,"P. V. Moniz, S. Jalalzadeh","gr-qc, hep-th, quant-ph","Fractional calculus is a couple of centuries old, but its development has been less embraced and it was only within the last century that a program of applications for physics started. Regarding quantum physics, it has been only in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature resulted in a set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial invitation, whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and unpretentious presentation, the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to cosmological settings. Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details (namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing. Subsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional calculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn (to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that may affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of minisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements, we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard cosmology. In summary, the subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith proposed, merely realized in terms of an open program constituted by several challenges."
163,Penalized Estimation and Forecasting of Multiple Subject Intensive   Longitudinal Data,"Zachary F. Fisher, Younghoon Kim, Barbara Fredrickson, Vladas Pipiras","stat.ME, stat.ML","Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD) is increasingly available to social and behavioral scientists. With this increased availability come new opportunities for modeling and predicting complex biological, behavioral, and physiological phenomena. Despite these new opportunities psychological researchers have not taken full advantage of promising opportunities inherent to this data, the potential to forecast psychological processes at the individual level. To address this gap in the literature we present a novel modeling framework that addresses a number of topical challenges and open questions in the psychological literature on modeling dynamic processes. First, how can we model and forecast ILD when the length of individual time series and the number of variables collected are roughly equivalent, or when time series lengths are shorter than what is typically required for time series analyses? Second, how can we best take advantage of the cross-sectional (between-person) information inherent to most ILD scenarios while acknowledging individuals differ both quantitatively (e.g. in parameter magnitude) and qualitatively (e.g. in structural dynamics)? Despite the acknowledged between-person heterogeneity in many psychological processes is it possible to leverage group-level information to support improved forecasting at the individual level? In the remainder of the manuscript, we attempt to address these and other pressing questions relevant to the forecasting of multiple-subject ILD."
164,Richness estimation with species identity error,"Jai-Hua Yen, Chun-Huo Chiu","stat.AP, stat.ME","Richness estimation of an interesting area is always a challenge statistical work due to small sample size or species identity error. In the literatures, most richness estimators were only proposed to tackle the underestimation of the size-limited sample. However, species identity error almost occurs in each species survey and seriously reduces the accuracy of observed, singleton, and doubleton richness in turns to influence the behavior of richness estimator. Therefore, to estimate the true richness, the biased collected data due to species identity error should be modified before processing the richness estimation work. In the manuscript, we propose a new approach to correct the bias of richness estimation due to species identity error. First, a species list inventory from a subplot obtained by the investigator was used to estimate the species identity error rate. Then, we can correct the biased observed, singleton, and doubleton richness of the raw sampling data from the interesting area. Finally, the richness estimators proposed in the literature could be supplied to get the more correct estimates based on adjusted observed data. To investigate the behavior of the proposed method, we performed simulations by generating data sets from various species models with different species identity error rates. For the purpose of illustration, the real data was supplied to demonstrate our proposed approach. A presence/absence weeds species was surveyed in the organic farmland located at Soft Bridge County in the North of Taiwan."
165,On Asteroid Retrieval Missions Enabled by Invariant Manifold Dynamics,"Jack Tyler, Alexander Wittig","astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, math.DS, 70F15 (Primary), 49K15 (Secondary)","In recent years, the retrieval of entire asteroids has received significant attention, with many approaches leveraging the invariant manifolds of the Circular-Restricted Three-body Problem to capture an asteroid into a periodic orbit about the $L_1$ or $L_2$ points of the Sun-Earth system. Previous works defined an `Easily Retrievable Object' (ERO) as any Near-Earth Object (NEO) which is retrievable using these invariant manifolds with an impulsive $\Delta v$ of less than $500$ m/s. We extend the previous literature by analysing the Pareto fronts for the EROs discovered for the first time, using high-performance computing to lift optimisation constraints used in previous literature, and modifying the method used to filter unsuitable NEOs from the NEO catalogue. In doing so, we can demonstrate that EROs have approximately the same transfer cost for almost any possible transfer time, including single-impulse transfers, which could offer significant flexibility to mission designers. We also identify $44$ EROs, of which $27$ are new, and improve on previously-known transfer solutions by up to $443$ m/s, including $17$ new capture trajectories with $\Delta v$ costs of less than $100$ m/s."
166,Systematic Literature Review: Quantum Machine Learning and its   applications,"David Peral Garc√≠a, Juan Cruz-Benito, Francisco Jos√© Garc√≠a-Pe√±alvo","quant-ph, cs.LG","Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2023 to identify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 94 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. Many articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential."
167,Efficient Integrated Volatility Estimation in the Presence of Infinite   Variation Jumps via Debiased Truncated Realized Variations,"B. Cooper Boniece, Jos√© E. Figueroa-L√≥pez, Yuchen Han","econ.EM, math.ST, q-fin.ST, stat.TH","Statistical inference for stochastic processes based on high-frequency observations has been an active research area for more than two decades. One of the most well-known and widely studied problems has been the estimation of the quadratic variation of the continuous component of an It\^o semimartingale with jumps. Several rate- and variance-efficient estimators have been proposed in the literature when the jump component is of bounded variation. However, to date, very few methods can deal with jumps of unbounded variation. By developing new high-order expansions of the truncated moments of a locally stable L\'evy process, we propose a new rate- and variance-efficient volatility estimator for a class of It\^o semimartingales whose jumps behave locally like those of a stable L\'evy process with Blumenthal-Getoor index $Y\in (1,8/5)$ (hence, of unbounded variation). The proposed method is based on a two-step debiasing procedure for the truncated realized quadratic variation of the process and can also cover the case $Y<1$. Our Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the method outperforms other efficient alternatives in the literature in the setting covered by our theoretical framework."
168,A numerical investigation of dimensionless numbers characterizing   meltpool morphology of the laser powder bed fusion process,"Kunal Bhagat, Shiva Rudraraju","math.NA, cs.NA","Microstructure evolution in metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a complex multi-physics and multi-scale problem. Understanding the impact of AM process conditions on the microstructure evolution and the resulting mechanical properties of the printed part is an active area of research. At the meltpool scale, the thermo-fluidic governing equations have been extensively modeled in the literature to understand the meltpool conditions and the thermal gradients in its vicinity. In many phenomena governed by partial differential equations, dimensional analysis and identification of important dimensionless numbers can provide significant insights into the process dynamics. In this context, a novel strategy using dimensional analysis and the method of linear least squares regression to numerically investigate the thermo-fluidic governing equations of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion AM process is presented in this work. First, the governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, and the model predictions are validated by comparing with experimentally estimated cooling rates, and with numerical results from the literature. Then, through dimensional analysis, an important dimensionless quantity - interpreted as a measure of heat absorbed by the powdered material and the meltpool, is identified. This dimensionless measure of heat absorbed, along with classical dimensionless quantities such as Peclet, Marangoni, and Stefan numbers, is used to investigate advective transport in the meltpool for different alloys. Further, the framework is used to study the variations of thermal gradients and the solidification cooling rate. Important correlations linking meltpool morphology and microstructure evolution related variables with classical dimensionless numbers are the key contribution of this work."
169,"Neurotrophic Effects of Intermittent Fasting, Calorie Restriction and   Exercise: A Review and Annotated Bibliography",Eric Mayor,q-bio.TO,"In the last decades, important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting (IF), caloric restriction (CR) and exercise. Improved neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis (NSPAN) are essential examples of these neurotrophic effects. The importance in this respect of the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone bodies as cellular fuel has been highlighted. More recently, calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs; resveratrol and other polyphenols in particular) have been investigated thoroughly in relation to NSPAN. In the narrative review sections of this manuscript, recent findings on these essential functions are synthesized and the most important molecules involved are presented. The most researched signaling pathways (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, GSK3$\beta$, ULK, MAPK, PGC-1$\alpha$, NF-$\kappa$B, sirtuins, Notch, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) and processes (e.g., anti-inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis) that support or thwart neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis are then briefly presented. This provides an accessible entry point to the literature. In the annotated bibliography section of this contribution, brief summaries are provided of about 30 literature reviews relating to the neurotrophic effects of interest in relation to IF, CR, CRMs and exercise. Most of the selected reviews address these essential functions from the perspective of healthier aging (sometimes discussing epigenetic factors) and the reduction of the risk for neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease) and depression or the improvement of cognitive function."
170,Guidelines for Material Design in Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells,"Karen Forberich, Alessandro Troisi, Chao Liu, Michael Wagner, Christoph J. Brabec, Hans-Joachim Egelhaaf",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) are uniquely suited for semitransparent applications due to their adjustable absorption spectrum. However, most high-performance semitransparent cells reported to date are based on materials that have shown high power conversion efficiency for opaque devices. We therefore present a model to assess the optimum efficiency and transparency for a specific donor and acceptor band gap. The absorption characteristics of both donor and acceptor are modeled with spectral data of typical absorber materials from the literature which are adjusted to achieve the desired band gap value. The results show three distinct regions of high light utilization efficiency if the photopic curve is employed as a weighting function (corresponding to window applications), and a broad maximum for the plant action spectrum as a weighting function (corresponding to greenhouse applications). When comparing these findings to reported experimental values, it is evident that the band gaps of the materials used for the experimental studies do not correspond to the maxima identified by our simulation model. The analysis of the energy levels of molecules recorded in the literature confirms that all band gaps and therefore all LUE maxima are chemically feasible so that the performance of semitransparent OSCs can be further improved by designing materials with optimized absorption spectra."

However, current literature primarily focuses on improving thermopower only, while the ion transport and thermodynamics affecting the efficiencies have been largely neglected. This review article clarifies the fundamentals of electrochemistry and thermodynamics for developing highly efficient i-TE devices. Two major types of i-TE devices, thermo-ionic capacitors (TIC) and thermogalvanic cells (TGC), are discussed in detail. The article analyzes the methods of enhancing ionic thermopower in the literature by taking an entropic point of view. We also derived modified thermoelectric factor Z for both TICs and TGCs that fully incorporate the dynamics of ion transport and electrochemical reactions. Recent developments of hybrid devices showing improved efficiencies, power density, and multifunctionality are reviewed. Finally, we comment on the remaining challenges and provide an outlook on future directions."
172,Approximation of non-linear SPDEs with additive noise via weighted   interacting particles systems: the stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation,"Letizia Angeli, Dan Crisan, Martin Kolodziejczyk, Michela Ottobre","math.PR, 35Q83, 35Q70, 60H15, 35R60, 65C35, 82M60","This paper is devoted to the problem of approximating non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) via interacting particle systems. In particular, we consider the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation, which is the McKean-Vlasov (MKV) PDE, perturbed by additive trace class noise. As is well-known, the MKV PDE can be obtained as mean field limit of the empirical measure of a stochastic system of interacting particles, where particles are subject to independent sources of noise. There is now a natural question, which is the one we consider and answer in this paper: can we obtain the SMKV equation, i.e. additive perturbations of the MKV PDE, as limit of interacting particle systems? It turns out that, in order to obtain the SMKV equation, one needs to study weighted empirical measures of particles, where the particles evolve according to a system of SDEs with independent noise, while the weights are time evolving and subject to common noise. The work of this manuscript therefore complements and contributes to various streams of literature, in particular: i) much attention in the community is currently devoted to obtaining SPDEs as scaling limits of appropriate dynamics; this paper contributes to a complementary stream, which is devoted to obtaining representations of SPDE through limits of empirical measures of interacting particle systems; ii) since the literature on limits of weighted empirical measures is often constrained to the case of static (random or deterministic) weights, this paper contributes to further expanding this line of research to the case of time-evolving weights."

Soykal, Geoffroy Hautier, Valentin Karassiouk, Mike Thewalt, Daniel Higginbottom, Stephanie Simmons",quant-ph,"The silicon T centre's narrow, telecommunications-band optical emission, long spin coherence, and direct photonic integration have spurred interest in this emitter as a spin-photon interface for distributed quantum computing and networking. However, key parameters of the T centre's spin-selective optical transitions remain undetermined or ambiguous in literature. In this paper we present a Hamiltonian of the T centre TX state and determine key parameters of the optical transition from T$_0$ to TX$_0$ from a combined analysis of published results, density functional theory, and new spectroscopy. We resolve ambiguous values of the internal defect potential in the literature, and we present the first measurements of electrically tuned T centre emission. As a result, we provide a model of the T centre's optical and spin properties under strain, electric, and magnetic fields that can be utilized for realizing quantum technologies."
174,A complete characterization of pairs of binary phylogenetic trees with   identical $A_k$-alignments,"Mirko Wilde, Mareike Fischer","q-bio.PE, math.CO","Phylogenetic trees play a key role in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. Typically, they are derived from aligned sequence data (like DNA, RNA, or proteins) by using optimization criteria like, e.g., maximum parsimony (MP). It is believed that the latter is able to reconstruct the \enquote{true} tree, i.e., the tree that generated the data, whenever the number of substitutions required to explain the data with that tree is relatively small compared to the size of the tree (measured in the number $n$ of leaves of the tree, which represent the species under investigation). However, reconstructing the correct tree from any alignment first and foremost requires the given alignment to perform differently on the \enquote{correct} tree than on others.   A special type of alignments, namely so-called $A_k$-alignments, has gained considerable interest in recent literature. These alignments consist of all binary characters (\enquote{sites}) which require precisely $k$ substitutions on a given tree. It has been found that whenever $k$ is small enough (in comparison to $n$), $A_k$-alignments uniquely characterize the trees that generated them. However, recent literature has left a significant gap between $n\leq 2k+2$ -- namely the cases in which no such characterization is possible -- and $n\geq 4k$ -- namely the cases in which this characterization works. It is the main aim of the present manuscript to close this gap, i.e., to present a full characterization of all pairs of trees that share the same $A_k$-alignment. In particular, we show that indeed every binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves is uniquely defined by its $A_k$-alignments if $n\geq 2k+3$. By closing said gap, we also ensure that our result is optimal."
175,Strong and weak quantitative estimates in slow-fast diffusions using   filtering techniques,"Sumith Reddy Anugu, Vivek S. Borkar","math.OC, math.PR, Primary: 60J60, Secondary: 60H10, 93E11, 93C70","The behavior of slow-fast diffusions as the separation of scale diverges is a well-studied problem in the literature. In this short paper, we revisit this problem and obtain a new shorter proof of existing strong quantitative convergence estimates (in particular, $L^2$ estimates) and weak convergence estimates in terms of $n$ (the parameter associated with the separation of scales). In particular, we obtain the rate of $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ in the strong convergence estimates and the rate of $n^{-1}$ for weak convergence estimate which are already known to be optimal in the literature. We achieve this using nonlinear filtering theory where we represent the evolution of faster diffusion in terms of its conditional distribution given the slower diffusion. We then use the well-known Kushner-Stratanovich equation which gives the evolution of the conditional distribution of the fast diffusion given the slow diffusion and establish that this conditional distribution approaches the invariant measure of the ``frozen"" diffusion (obtained by freezing the slow variable in the evolution equation of the fast diffusion). At the heart of the analysis lies a key estimate of a weighted total variation distance between a generic measure and the unique invariant measure (of the ``frozen"" diffusion). This estimate is in terms of the operator norm of the dual of the infinitesimal generator of the ``frozen"" diffusion."
176,The Cosmological Baryon Density from Deuterium in QSO Spectra,"David Tytler, Scott Burles",astro-ph,"The primordial D/H ratio now provides the best measure of the cosmological density of baryons. We describe in detail how we deduce the D/H ratio from absorption lines in the spectra of quasars, and we present our first two measurements of D/H in different QSOs, which agree to within the random errors. We describe how we correct D/H for blending with Lyman alpha forest H lines. For our two QSOs these corrections are small, because the D lines are narrow, deep and constrained by H and metal lines. The similarity of the two measurements rules out ad hoc astrophysical effects, such as the destruction of D without production of metals, or unusual data problems. We are confident that we have measured the primordial abundance of D (log D/H $= -4.62 \pm 0.05$), which is the first such measurement because other values in the literature are much larger, and apparently strongly contaminated."
177,A Medium Survey of the Hard X-Ray Sky with ASCA. II.: The Source's Broad   Band X-Ray Spectral Properties,"R. Della Ceca, G. Castelli, V. Braito, I. Cagnoni, T. Maccacaro",astro-ph,"A complete sample of 60 serendipitous hard X-ray sources with flux in the range $\sim 1 \times 10^{-13}$ \ecs to $\sim 4 \times 10^{-12}$ \ecs (2 - 10 keV), detected in 87 ASCA GIS2 images, was recently presented in literature. Using this sample it was possible to extend the description of the 2-10 keV LogN(>S)-LogS down to a flux limit of $\sim 6\times 10^{-14}$ \ecs (the faintest detectable flux), resolving about a quarter of the Cosmic X-ray Background. In this paper we have combined the ASCA GIS2 and GIS3 data of these sources to investigate their X-ray spectral properties using the ""hardness"" ratios and the ""stacked"" spectra method. Because of the sample statistical representativeness, the results presented here, that refer to the faintest hard X-ray sources that can be studied with the current instrumentation, are relevant to the understanding of the CXB and of the AGN unification scheme."
178,Near-infrared Spectra of Chamaeleon I Stars,"M. Gomez, D. Mardones",astro-ph,"We present low resolution (R = 500) near-infrared spectra of 46 candidate young stellar objects in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region recently detected in several deep photometric surveys of the cloud. Most of these stars have K < 12. In addition, we present spectra of 63 previously known southern hemisphere young stars mainly belonging to the Chamaeleon I and Lupus dark clouds. We describe near-infrared spectroscopic characteristics of these stars and use the water vapor indexes to derive spectral types for the new objects. Photometric data from the literature are used to estimate the bolometric luminosities of all sources. We apply D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1998) pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks and isocrones to derive masses and ages. We detect two objects with mass below the H burning limit among the 46 new candidates. One of this object (PMK99 IR Cha INa1) is the likely driving source of a bipolar outflow in the northern region of the cloud."
179,Optical spectra of selected Chamaeleon I young stellar objects,"C. Saffe, M. Gomez, S. Randich, D. Mardones, P. Caselli, P. Persi, G. Racca",astro-ph,"We present optical spectra of eight candidate brown dwarfs and a previously known T Tauri star (Sz 33) of the Chamaeleon I dark cloud. We derived spectral types based on the strength of the TiO or VO absorption bands present in the spectra of these objects as well as on the PC3 index of Martin et al. (1999). Photometric data from the literature are used to estimate the bolometric luminosities for these sources. We apply D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997) pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks and isochrones to derive masses and ages. Based on the presence of Halpha in emission, we confirm that most of the candidates are young objects. Our sample however includes two sources for which we can only provide upper limits for the emission in Halpha; whereas these two objects are most likely foreground/background stars, higher resolution spectra are required to confirm their true nature. Among the likely cloud members, we detect one new sub-stellar object and three transition stellar/sub-stellar sources."
180,Using the Parallel Virtual Machine for Everyday Analysis,"M. S. Noble, J. C. Houck, J. E. Davis, A. Young, M. Nowak","astro-ph, cs.DC","A review of the literature reveals that while parallel computing is sometimes employed by astronomers for custom, large-scale calculations, no package fosters the routine application of parallel methods to standard problems in astronomical data analysis. This paper describes our attempt to close that gap by wrapping the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) as a scriptable S-Lang module. Using PVM within ISIS, the Interactive Spectral Interpretation System, we've distributed a number of representive calculations over a network of 25+ CPUs to achieve dramatic reductions in execution times. We discuss how the approach applies to a wide class of modeling problems, outline our efforts to make it more transparent for common use, and note its growing importance in the context of the large, multi-wavelength datasets used in modern analysis."
181,Cosmic-ray propagation and interactions in the Galaxy,"Andrew W. Strong, Igor V. Moskalenko, Vladimir S. Ptuskin",astro-ph,"We survey the theory and experimental tests for the propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy up to energies of 10^15 eV. A guide to the previous reviews and essential literature is given, followed by an exposition of basic principles. The basic ideas of cosmic-ray propagation are described, and the physical origin of its processes are explained. The various techniques for computing the observational consequences of the theory are described and contrasted. These include analytical and numerical techniques. We present the comparison of models with data including direct and indirect - especially gamma-ray - observations, and indicate what we can learn about cosmic-ray propagation. Some particular important topics including electrons and antiparticles are chosen for discussion."
182,Prediction Errors and Local Lyapunov Exponents,"Matthew B. Kennel, Henry D. I. Abarbanel, J. J. ""Sid"" Sidorowich","chao-dyn, nlin.CD","It is frequently asserted that in a chaotic system two initially close points will separate at an exponential rate governed by the largest global Lyapunov exponent. Local Lyapunov exponents, however, are more directly relevant to predictability. The difference between the local and global Lyapunov exponents, the large variations of local exponents over an attractor, and the saturation of error growth near the size of the attractor---all result in non-exponential scalings in errors at both short and long prediction times, sometimes even obscuring evidence of exponential growth. Failure to observe exponential error scaling cannot rule out deterministic chaos as an explanation. We demonstrate a simple model that quantitatively predicts observed error scaling from the local Lyapunov exponents, for both short and surprisingly long times. We comment on the relevance to atmospheric predictability as studied in the meteorological literature."
183,Effect of La-doping on growth and superconductivity of Bi-2212 crystals,"H. Jin, J. K√∂tzler",cond-mat.supr-con,"Single crystals of the layered superconductor Bi2Sr2(Ca1-xLax)Cu2O8+d were successfully grown out by a self-flux method. Upon La-doping, the c-axis contracts but the structure remains stable up to the critical concentration xc, above which the crystals contain the pure Bi2(Sr,La)2CuO6 phase. The reduction of the superconducting transition temperature follows a linear relation, Tc(x)=Tc(0) (1-x/xc), with xc=0.3 being consistent with the structure data. This and a comparison with literature data on Pr3+- (xc>>0.65) and Y3+-doping (xc=1) indicate an intimate relation between structural and superconducting stability in the 2212 phase. Besides the widely discussed hole-filling effect, the structural instability due to the substitution of large La3+ for Ca2+ is considered to be another contribution to Tc suppression in this system."

185,QCD Equalities for Baryon Current Matrix Elements,Derek B. Leinweber,"hep-ph, nucl-th","An examination of the symmetries manifest in the QCD path integral for current matrix elements reveals various equalities among the quark sector contributions. QCD equalities among octet baryon magnetic moments lead to a determination of the disconnected sea-quark contribution to nucleon magnetic moments, which is the most reliable determination in the literature. Matching QCD equalities to recent calculations of decuplet baryon magnetic moments in chiral perturbation theory (ChiPT) reveals an equivalence between ChiPT to order $p^2$ and the simple quark model with an explicit disconnected sea-quark contribution. New insights into SU(3)-flavor symmetry breaking, sea contributions and constituent quark composition are obtained. The strangeness contribution to nucleon magnetic moments is found to be large at $G_M^s(0) = -0.75 \pm 0.30\ \mu_N$. The QCD equalities must be followed by any model which hopes to capture the essence of nonperturbative QCD. Not all models are in accord with these symmetries."
